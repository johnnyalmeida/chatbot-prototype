In this video, we’ll play a fun game where we take a look at different behavior in the classroom. We decide which behaviors will help us and our classmates learn, and have a good time in school. If you get four school behaviors in a row - up, down, across, or diagonal - you can say “bingo!” The first person to get bingo is the winner! Whenever we see this icon in the corner, we can stop and talk about what just happened. Let’s get started! To start our game, let’s focus on Liz. Teacher: What's the capital of California? Yes, Liz? Liz: Sacramento. Teacher: That's right! Nice job. Liz knew the answer to the question. What important classroom behavior did she use? Liz... raised her hand before she spoke. Liz knew the answer to the question, so she raised her hand, waited to be called on, and then said the answer. In class, it’s important that we raise our hand before we speak. Find “Raise Your Hand” on your board, and mark it! This time, we’ll focus on Kate. She wants to give the answer to a question in class. Teacher: Does anyone know the square root of 16? Jake? Jake: Four. Kate raised her hand to speak, but the teacher called on someone else. What did Kate do? Kate… waited her turn and didn’t speak when she wasn’t called on. Kate wanted to answer the question, but she didn’t yell out the answer when the teacher called on someone else. It can be really hard when we don’t get called on, but it’s important to keep our self control. We’ll get our turn eventually! Find “Wait your turn” on your board, and mark it! For this video, we’ll focus on Kate again. What happens when she’s having trouble with her work? Teacher: Kate, do you need some help? Kate: Yes. I can't figure out how to do number four. Teacher: Which part are you having trouble with? Kate: I can't figure out the remainder. Teacher: Okay, let's take a look. Kate was feeling frustrated there. What did she do to help her problem? Kate… accepted help from her teacher. Sometimes we get frustrated with our work. If we accept help and explain our problem to the teacher, we can make it easier on ourselves and solve our problem. Teacher: Which part are you having trouble with? Kate: I can’t figure out the remainder. Teacher: Okay, let’s take a look. Find “Accept Help” on your board, and mark it! This time, we’ll focus on the whole class. What do they do when they need to leave the classroom? Teacher: It's time to line up. Okay, do we have everyone? Let's go. What did the class do when they left the classroom? The class… walked together in line. When we need to leave the classroom, we should line up quietly when the teacher asks us. Teacher: It's time to line up. We want to be close to our classmates, but not too close. And we walk quietly in a straight line in the halls. Find “Walk in Line” on your board, and mark it! We're going to focus on the whole group. How do they act when they have a project to do together? Tyler: Okay. So we have to pick which of the founding fathers we want to do our project on. Kate: What about Thomas Jefferson? Serena: Works for me. Tyler: Alright. Now we need to decide who's going to start the report and who's going to start the poster. Serena: I can start the poster. Jake: I could do the poster too. Tyler: Alright, sounds good. Tyler: Kate and I can start the report and you two could start the poster. Kate: Sounds good! What did the group do? The group cooperated with their group members. Everyone was nice to each other. The group chose a topic together. Kate: What about Thomas Jefferson? Serena: Works for me! Tyler: Alright! And split up the work evenly. Tyler: Now we need to decide who's going to start the report and who's going to start the poster. Serena: I can start the poster. Jake: I could do the poster too. Tyler: Alright, sounds good. Tyler: Kate and I can start the report and you two could start the poster. Kate: Sounds good. When we have to work in groups in school, it’s important to work nicely together. We all have to do our fair share of the work. Find “Cooperate With Group Members” on your board, and mark it! In this video, let’s focus on Christine. She gets very excited when the group starts talking about Transformers. Devin: Hey, my brother was watching the Transformers movie yesterday. It's pretty cool. Christine: I love Transformers! Transformers! Transformers! Woo! Julie: Yeah, they're pretty cool. Christine: Hmm... Julie is looking at me funny. Whoops! I was using my silly voice. I got really excited. But at school I should use my talking voice. Christine: I really like the characters Megatron, Jazz, and Optimus Prime. Devin: It's cool how they transform. Julie: Yeah. I like the character Bumblebee too. Christine: His colors are awesome. What did Christine realize there? How did she change her behavior because she was in school? Christine… used her school voice. Christine sometimes uses silly voices when she’s at home. She accidentally used a silly voice. Christine: I love Transformers! Transformers! Transformers! Woo! But she realized she was in school and changed her talking voice for school. Christine: I really like the characters Megatron, Jazz, and Optimus Prime. Nice job, Christine! Find “Use School Voice” on your board, and mark it! This time, we’ll focus on Chris. What happens when it’s time to work on his poster? Teacher: Okay, class. It's time to finish the posters we started yesterday. Chris: I don't want to do my poster. Teacher: Chris, the posters are due today. If you don't finish it, you can't get a grade. You're almost done with it too. Chris: I don't want to do the poster. But if I don't, what might happen? I could get a bad grade. My mom will not be happy about that. I'm frustrated because I can't figure something out. Teacher: I'm glad you asked for help. Let's look at it together. Chris did not want to work on his poster. But what classroom behavior did he show? Chris… did things he didn’t want to do. Sometimes, we don’t want to do the work but we have to because it will help us learn. It’s important that even if we don’t want to do something, we do what our teachers ask. Find “Do Things We Don’t Want to Do” on your board, and mark it! In this video, Serena is upset when the schedule for the day changes. What does she do to feel better? Alessandra: Do you guys know what we're doing in gym today? Bobby: We don't have gym today. We're going to an assembly. Serene: What? Bobby: We're going to an assembly. Serena: I'm feeling really uncomfortable. My stomach feels upset. That means I'm feeling nervous. I need to calm down. Today will be different, but I can go to gym tomorow. I guess we'll go to gym tomorrow. Serena was feeling upset, but was able to calm down. How was she acting? Serena… was flexible. It can be hard for us when our schedule changes, or when something different happens in our school day. If we’re able to be flexible and adapt with the changes, we won’t get upset when our plans change. Find “Be Flexible” on your board, and mark it! Let’s watch how Alessandra acts during a class assignment. Teacher: Right now it's Math time, Andrew. You can read later. Andrew: Okay. Alessandra got upset when she saw Andrew reading. What did she do next? Alessandra… didn’t worry about others. Alessandra gets upset when the other students break the rules or do things they aren't suppose to. But... Alessandra tries to ignore the other student’s behavior and only worry about herself. If there’s a problem, the teacher will handle it. Alessandra didn’t disrupt the class and was able to continue her work. Find “Don’t Worry About Others” on your board, and mark it! For our last video, let’s see how Josh handles doing school work. Teacher: Okay, class, it's time for vocab. Take out your notebooks and we'll get started. Josh: Ugh, I hate vocab. It's so boring. I don't want to do it. But I also don't want to disrupt the class. I guess I just have to do it. Josh didn’t want to do school work. But what did he do? Josh… used a filter. Josh could have yelled or told the teacher how he felt. But Josh remembered that in school, we have to use a filter. If we don’t have something nice to say, we should keep that thought inside our heads. Find “Use a Filter” on your board, and mark it! Great job, everyone! We learned a lot about school behaviors today! Some of the things we should remember are: We raise our hand to talk in class. We follow the classroom rules. Teacher: It's time to line up. And we are flexible in school. Serena: I guess we'll go to gym tomorrow. See you next time! "," - Welcome to How We Act in School bingo!

We can’t let other people solve our problems for us. Let’s watch Mike take responsibility. Kate: Hey, Mike. What was that YouTube video you were telling us about? Mike: Oh, it was so funny. Kate: Oh, that's cool. Come show us. Teacher: Who forgot to clean up their work from the table? Anyone? We can’t leave the classroom messy like that. Mike: Oh no! I left that stuff on the table. I didn't do it on purpose. I don't want to get in trouble, so I'm not going to say anything. Teacher: All right. Well, then everyone will have to go over and clean and tomorrow, we won't have a free period. We know that Mike made the mess. But he didn't want to get in trouble, so he didn't say anything. Let's see how that made the other students feel. Sarah: Mike made the mess, but I didn't want to say anything. Now, we all got in trouble. The other students are upset with Mike. He didn't take responsibility for his actions. Now all the students had to clean up his mess, and everyone lost a free period.

Making smart decisions makes our life easier and keeps us out of trouble. We make lots of small decisions every single day, like what to eat, play or wear, but these are not the decisions we’re talking about today. We’re talking about being smart when we make difficult decisions. These difficult decisions are about: our feelings, others’ feelings, issues about right and wrong. These types of decisions need time and careful thinking. Some examples are which friends to spend time with and how to behave at school and at home. Think about what you would do if you saw a friend being teased? What would you do if you saw a friend cheating? Some skills that would help us solve these are: Stop and think There’s always more than one choice to make. We need time to think about each choice. We often pick the wrong decision when we forget to slow down and think it through. Think of options Ask, “What are my options?” When we consider all of the options, we think through our choices before we pick one. Think about what would be best for you now and in the future. Avoid peer pressure Once we pick a choice, we ask ourselves, “Why do I want to do this?” Are we making a decision based on what we know is right or because we feel pressured by our friends? It is never a good idea to do something just because someone else tells you to. Be a good predictor Ask “What will happen next?” Good decision makers think about what will happen. Ask, will I get in trouble or hurt someone’s feelings? Apply these steps to this problem we mentioned earlier: “What would you do if you saw a friend being teased?” To help us make good decisions, we should: Ask for Help When it seems like there are no good decisions to make, or that some people are getting hurt, ask for help. It’s time to talk to an adult when you can’t think of any good choices. We can ask for help by saying, “I need some help with a problem” or “Will you help me think this through?” Learn from Mistakes Remember, it’s okay to make mistakes. It’s a normal part of being a kid and an adult. We all try our best to learn from our mistakes. Finally, practice. Making good decisions takes practice.

Self-esteem keeps us feeling good about ourselves during our struggles or bad days. It’s important we learn to develop positive self-esteem so we can feel confident trying new things, being around friends, and adding to our talents. When we have low self-esteem, it can make us feel unsure of ourselves, like we don’t belong. Low self-esteem makes us give up easily when things are challenging. Here are some ways to build positive self-esteem: Make a list of things you are good at. When we sit down and take time to recognize our strengths, it reminds us we have lots of valuable and unique skills. Practice the things you’re good at. When we do things that we enjoy and are good at, it fills us up with positive feelings. Have a growth mindset. Everything is not going to come easily to us, and there is value in improving and working to get better. By telling ourselves, “I can” instead of “I can’t,” we believe that we can improve. Set goals and work hard towards them. When we accomplish a goal, it gives us the confidence of one more thing we can do well. Spend time with people who care about you. Find people who accept us for who we are and make us feel comfortable. This builds positive feelings in ourselves. Help others. This could mean helping with chores around the house, listening to a peer who needs a friend, or even doing charity work in our community. When we do kind things for others, the connection with people gives us confidence. Now is a good time to pause and discuss these strategies with the class. Talk about ones that you already do and ones you can try to do more of. Remember, when the voice in your head says, “I’m not good at this” or “This is too hard,” decide to change your mind. Use positive self-talk to replace those ‘I can’t’ statements with things like: “I can give this a try.” “I’m going to try my best.” “I’ll ask someone to help me do this.” We are all worthy, special, and unique in our own ways and should feel proud to be ourselves! DISCUSSION: Define self-esteem. What could we say instead of, “This is too hard,” to practice a growth mindset? Why can having a low self-esteem be harmful? Why is recognizing our strengths so important to developing positive self-esteem? "," Self-esteem is the group of beliefs you have about yourself. When you have a high sense of self-esteem, you feel proud of what you can do, feel liked and accepted, and confident in your abilities, even when you fail. Self-esteem keeps us feeling good about ourselves during our struggles or bad days. It’s important we learn to develop positive self-esteem so we can feel confident trying new things, being around friends, and adding to our talents.

How can setting a goal for yourself help you accomplish it faster?,Solving a Problem,,,,,,https://res.cloudinary.com/everyday-speech/raw/upload/v1619186994/SubtitlesVTT/SEL04_Setting_Goals.vtt," We set goals to keep us focused on something we want to accomplish. We do this because there are so many outward and inward distractions that pull us away from our goals. Outward distractions are things like screens, obligations, or other demands on our time. Inward distractions are our doubting inner thoughts that talk us out of working toward our goal. “I’ll start tomorrow” and “It doesn’t matter anyway” are common inner thoughts. Setting goals can help us get past these obstacles so that we can make lasting personal progress and feel happier. There’s no one way to set goals, but here are some tips that can help you make the most progress. Make a To Do List of what you need to accomplish before you can start working on your goal. Take small steps. Break the goal down into smaller steps and accomplish one step at a time. Get a partner to join you so you hold each other accountable. Set up rewards at each level. Pair it with something you already like doing. Choose a start day. Track progress if it motivates you. Let’s practice setting a goal for ourselves. Make sure you have something to write with now. Teachers, you can pause the video to allow everyone writing time. One, Name one goal you would like to accomplish. This can be school-related or life-related. Write your goal down now. Two, Make a To Do list. What do you need to do before you can work on this goal? Do you need to clean a space, gather materials, or buy something? Write your To Do list now. Three, Break your goal into 3-5 smaller steps. Accomplishing a big goal is really accomplishing many small steps, one at a time. Write your 3-5 smaller steps toward your goal now. Goals only stay exciting for a short while, then they can feel a lot like work. To keep making progress, the following things can help you stay on track. Write down the name of someone who can join you. Write down a reward you can give yourself for accomplishing each of your smaller steps. Pair something you like doing with your new habit, like listening to music while doing homework. Write down your pairing now. Choose a start day and write it down. Try tracking your progress. If you find it motivating, it may be the key that keeps you on track. You’ve just set a specific goal you care about. GROUP DISCUSSION: What is your goal and how will you accomplish it?

Somebody turn this dumb movie off! 44 What happened there? 45 Did Bruno use his Self-Controller Scanner 46 to help him stay in control? 47 Let’s see what everyone is thinking. 48 Bruno: I don’t like loud movies. 49 They make me uncomfortable. 50 Nikki: What's going on with Bruno? 51 Bruno didn’t know how to ask for what he needed. 52 This left him feeling upset. 53 Let’s watch him try again 54 using his words to let others know what he needs. 55 Mr. Cheng: Alright, class, you earned a Fun Friday! 56 We’re going to watch a movie for the rest of the afternoon. 57 Bruno: I’m starting to get really upset. 58 I should use my Self-Controller Scanner. 59 This movie is too loud! It’s hurting my ears. 60 I need to let Mr. Cheng know that the sound is too loud for me. 61 I can ask for my headphones. 62 Bruno: Excuse me, the sound is hurting my ears. 63 Can I get my headphones? 64 Mr. Cheng: Of course! 65 Thank you for letting me know. 66 I’ll turn it down a bit for you, too. 67 Did Bruno use his Self-Controller Scanner to stay calm that time? 68 He did! 69 Let’s see what everyone is thinking. 70 Bruno: It felt good to ask for what I needed. 71 Now I can watch the movie. 72 Nikki: It’s no big deal. 73 Bruno just needed his headphones. 74 Everybody is different. 75 Bruno picked a strategy that worked best for him that time. 76 By speaking up, he was able to stay in control of his feelings. 77 Learning to speak allows us to get what we need really quickly. 78 That’s why we use our Self-Controller Scanner to help us. 79 What did we learn? 80 We use our Self-Controller Scanner 81 to notice how we’re feeling 82 and pick a strategy to help us get back in control. 83 To advocate for ourselves in the classroom, we: 84 Consider the time and place. 85 Is the teacher talking? 86 Raise your hand before speaking up. 87 Speak respectfully. 88 Use an appropriate tone of voice. 89 Clearly communicate what you need to help you regain control.

Personal space is the space we all need between each other’s bodies so that we feel comfortable. Personal space is like an ‘invisible bubble’ surrounding our bodies. As a rule, most people like to keep one arm’s length from each other’s bodies. We can use the Relationship Ruler to help us know how much personal space to keep with different people. With strangers or acquaintances, we leave more distance or personal space between our bodies. With friends or close friends, we can be closer to each other without feeling uncomfortable. We still keep some space. With family, we feel comfortable being close to each other. It’s okay to touch or hug our family members without worrying about keeping too much personal space. We can also read others’ body language to help us know if we are invading their personal space. If we get too close, people might back away from us to let us know they need more space. We keep personal space so others feel happy and comfortable around us. To Keep Personal Space, we: Keep an invisible space bubble that’s one arm’s length away.

Did Liz keep personal space when she talked to Ashley? Yes, she did. First, she thought about her relationship with Ashley. Then, she kept her space bubble by staying an arm’s length away.

When we tell a story, we need to give all of the background information. If we leave anything out, people could be confused. When we're talking to others, we need to make sure we tell them Who we are talking about What happened Where we went When it happened For each video, we'll listen to the story being told and decide if any information is missing. Pay attention to how successful the character story is to help you figure out if anything is missing. Let's get started. Listen to Madison's story and see if any background information is missing. Madison: Guess what. Julie and I went to the mall last week and got our ears pierced. Haley: Oh! Madison: Julie was so nervous. She thought it was going to hurt. Haley: Julie, is she your friend? Madison: But it didn't hurt. She was fine. Did Madison tell Haley every piece of background information? Let's listen again. Madison: Guess what. Julie and I went to the mall last week and got our ears pierced. Haley: Oh! Madison: Julie was so nervous. She thought it was going to hurt. Haley: Julie, is she your friend? Madison: But it didn't hurt. She was fine. Did Madison leave any parts out? She left out the who by not explaining who Julie is. Let's see how this made Haley feel. Haley: Who's Julie? I'm not sure who that is. Madison's never talked about Julie before. Haley felt confused when Madison didn't tell her who she was talking about. Even though she said Julie's name, she didn't explain who she was. So Haley didn't know who she was talking about. Let's watch Madison tell her all of the background information. Madison: Guess what. My cousin, Julie, and I went to the mall last week and got our ears pierced. Haley: Oh, awesome! Was it your first time? Madison: No, I've had it done before, but Julie never had. She was really nervous. Haley: People always think it's going to hurt, but it doesn't. That time, Madison told Haley all of the information. She included the who, what, where, and when. Let's watch one more time and see how Madison gives Haley the background brief. Madison: Guess what. My cousin, Julie, and I went to the mall last week and got our ears pierced. That time, Madison made sure to tell Haley that Julie was her cousin. Now, Haley wasn't confused. Listen to Rachel's story and see if any background information is missing. Zach: I'm going to Arizona to visit my brother for spring vacation. Rachel: Cool! I was in Canada with my family, and we went on a boat ride through Niagara Falls. Zach: You went or are you going? Rachel: Yeah. It's a cool place. Did Rachel tell Zach every piece of background information? Zach: I'm going to Arizona to visit my brother for spring vacation. Rachel: Cool! I was in Canada with my family, and we went on a boat ride through Niagara Falls. Zach: You went or are you going? Rachel: Yeah. It's a cool place. Which part did Rachel leave out? She left out the when. Let's see how this made Zach feel. Zach: When did Rachel go to Canada? Was it recent or was it a long time ago? Zach felt confused when Rachel didn't mention when she went to Canada. Without the when, her comment seemed off topic and didn't relate to his story about vacation. Let's watch Rachel tell Zach all of the background information. Zach: I'm going to Arizona to visit my brother for spring vacation. Rachel: Cool! Last year for spring break, I went to Canada with my family, and we went on a boat ride through Niagara Falls. Zach: Wow! That must have been so cool to see. Rachel: Yeah. It was a cool vacation. Zach: I've never been to Canada before. That time, Rachel gave all of the information in her story. She included the who, what, where, and when. Let's watch that one more time and see how Rachel gave Zach the background brief. Rachel: Last year for spring break, I went to Canada with my family, and we went on a boat ride through Niagara Falls. Now, no one was confused. Let's listen to Justin's story and see if any background information is missing. Zach: I really wish we had cheese burgers for lunch today. Justin: My brother and I got these giant burgers last weekend. They were so good! They have tons of toppings too. Zach: Oh, I love burgers! Justin: You have to go! Did Justin tell Zach every piece of background information? Let's listen again. Zach: I really wish we had cheese burgers for lunch today. Justin: My brother and I got these giant burgers last weekend. They were so good! They have tons of toppings too. Zach: Oh, I love burgers! Justin: You have to go! Which part did Justin leave out? He left out the where. Let's see how this made Zach feel. Zach: Where did Justin get that burger? He keeps saying they're so good, but I don't even know where he went. Zach felt confused when Justin told him about the burgers, but didn't tell him where they were from. Let's watch Justin make sure to tell Zach all of the background information. Zach: I really wish we had cheese burgers for lunch today. Justin: My brother and I got these giant burgers from Boca Burger last weekend. They were so good! They have tons of toppings too. Zach: Oh, I love burgers! Justin: You have to go there! Zach: Yeah. I really need to try them. That time, Justin gave all of the information in his story. He included the who, what, where, and when. Let's listen to Justin's complete story one more time to hear each part of background information. Justin: My brother and I got these giant burgers from Boca Burger last weekend. This time, Zach wasn't confused. Remember to include all of the background information anytime you tell someone a story. We just saw a few examples of successful and not so successful storytelling. When we talk to others, remember the background brief. All of the background information we need to include so we don't make others feel confused. In order for everyone to understand your story, you should include: Who we are talking about What happened Where we went When it happened If we leave any of these information out, our stories might not make sense. Think about your listener and what they need to understand you. By going through your background brief, you'll remember to include each part and have successful conversations. See you next time!

In this video, we try to figure out how people are going to react to different situations. After each video, we’ll give you three choices. You have to guess which one is going to happen. This video is all about Tone of Voice. Our tone of voice is the way our voice sounds. It can send people messages without us even knowing it. So it’s not just the words we say, but also how we say it. We’ll try to guess how people react to the message being sent by the tone of voice. Whenever we see this icon in the corner, we can stop and talk about the situation. Let’s get started! Alessandra has a gift for Serena. Let’s watch what happens. Alessandra: Hey, I've been working on bracelet making in art class, and I made this for you. Serena: Wow, it's great. That went pretty fast. Let’s watch that one more time. Focus on Serena’s tone of voice. Alessandra: Hey, I've been working on bracelet making in art class, and I made this for you. Serena: Wow, it's great. Serena told Alessandra she loves the bracelet. What will happen next? Alessandra will… Be happy that Serena likes it. Give Serena another gift. Think that Serena doesn’t like it. Alessandra: Is something wrong? Do you not like it? Serena: No, I really like it. It's awesome. Alessandra: I can fix it if you don't like it. Serena: No, I swear. It's great. Alessandra: Oh... okay. Why would Alessandra think that Serena didn’t like the bracelet when Serena said she liked it? Serena’s tone of voice didn’t match her message. Her tone was very flat. She didn’t sound excited. Serena: Wow, it's great. That led Alessandra to think she really didn’t like it. How would your voice sound if you wanted to show that you’re happy with something? Josh is working at his desk when he starts making some noise. Let’s watch him after Liz tells him to stop. Liz: Would you stop that? I'm trying to work here! Josh: Oh...okay. Sorry about that What do you think Josh will be thinking? Josh will think… That he shouldn’t have been clicking his pen. That he feels hurt by Liz. That his work was really hard. Josh: That didn't make me feel very good. I didn't even realize I was clicking my pen. Liz could have at least been nicer. How did we know how Josh was going to feel? His voice was very small and quiet. Josh: Oh...okay. Sorry about that. That’s usually a sign that someone feels sad about something. If we hear someone’s voice sound like that, we could ask them if anything’s wrong and try to make them feel better. Can you remember a time you could tell how someone was feeling based on their tone of voice? Liz and Matt are talking. Let’s see how Liz responds to Matt’s comment. Matt: I'm so hungry! I could eat a whole pizza after school! Liz: If you eat a whole pizza, you will get so sick. What do you think Matt will say? Matt will say… “I can eat that many pieces and not get sick.” “I was just joking.” “You’re right, I shouldn’t eat that much.” Matt: Oh, I was just joking around. I'm really hungry, but I wouldn't eat a whole pizza. Liz: Oh, I get it now. Matt was just joking. If we listen to his tone of voice, he’s laughing a little bit, and his tone of voice sounds a bit higher than usual. Matt: I’m so hungry. I could eat a whole pizza after school. Matt wasn’t being literal when he talked. That means he wasn’t actually going to eat a whole pizza. He was exaggerating to be funny. Alessandra has some news for Serena about their game. Let’s see. Alessandra: Hey, did you hear they cancelled the game today? The weather isn't looking too good. Serena: That's just what I needed! What do you think will happen next? Serena will… Be happy that the game is cancelled. Be upset that the game is cancelled. Be confused at why the game is cancelled. Serena: I'm glad they cancelled the game today. I hurt my ankle. So I was worried I wouldn't have a good game. Serena was happy the game was cancelled. Her tone of voice sounded happy and matched her message. Serena: That's just what I needed! Let’s watch that same scene again. When Alessandra has some news for Serena about their game. Alessandra: Hey, did you hear they cancelled the game today? The weather isn't looking too good. Serena: That's just what I needed. How do you think Serena feels this time? Serena will… Be happy that the game is cancelled. Be upset that the game is cancelled. Be confused at why the game is cancelled. Serena: Ugh! I wanted to play the game today so bad. I practiced so much last week. I was excited to play! Serena was upset that the game is cancelled. Her tone of voice was sarcastic. That changed her message to be the opposite of what she actually said. Let’s look at how both ways were different. Last time, her tone matched her words. Serena: That's just what I needed! This time, her voice sounded different. Serena: That's just what I needed! We need to pay a lot of attention to tone of voice! It can completely change the meaning of what you’re saying! Say “I love broccoli” once with a regular tone and then once with a sarcastic tone. How does your voice change? How does the meaning change? Serena has something to talk about with Tyler. How can we tell how she’s feeling from her tone of voice? Tyler: Hey, Serena! Serena: Hi, Tyler! Tyler: What's up? Serena: We need to talk! How do you think Tyler will react? Tyler will… Realize this is serious. Joke around with Serena. Get angry at Serena for interrupting. Tyler: What's wrong? Serena: You didn't send us your part of the project! It's due tomorrow and we're worried we're not going to finish now! Tyler: I'm so sorry. I finished it. I must have forgotten to email it. I'll do that right now. Serena: Okay, awesome. Tyler realized Serena had something serious to talk about. How did he know? Tyler listened to Serena’s tone of voice. Serena: We need to talk. He could tell it was serious because Serena didn’t sound happy at all. Her voice was loud and she wasn’t smiling. He changed his behavior to match hers once he realized something was wrong. For our final video, we’ll see how Kate feels after she asks for her book back from Serena. Kate: I let you borrow my Math book last week. Can I have it back now? Serena: Ah... actually... I lost it. Kate: What? Kate only said one word. Do you know how she’s feeling? What will happen next? Kate will… Not care, she has another book. Get angry with Serena. Get sad she doesn’t have a book. Serena: I can't find it anywhere. Kate: You should have told me! Kate was definitely angry there. When she said, “What?” her voice was very loud, fast, and didn’t sound happy at all. It was a lower pitch than her usual tone of voice. Kate: What? Her next comment was even louder. Kate: You should have told me! Say the word 'what' three times. Try to sound angry, confused, and surprised. How does your tone of voice change? Great job, everyone! We learned that someone’s tone can tell you a lot about their message. It can... Tell you how they feel about something. Serena: We need to talk! Completely change the meaning of their words. Serena: That's just what I needed! Serena: That's just what I needed. Or tell you how you should respond to something. Matt: I’m so hungry! I could eat a whole pizza after school. When you’re talking, and when you’re listening, pay attention to tone of voice. You could be sending messages without even knowing it. See you next time! "," - Welcome to Guess What Happens Next.

We have a responsibility to stand up for others who are being bullied. This is called being an Upstander. line:20% To be an Upstander, we might say things to the bully like, line:20% “No need to be mean.” line:20% “Come on, let’s be nice.” line:20% ""That's not cool."" line:20% or “Why’d you say that?” line:20% Speaking up does two things. line:20% First, it supports the person who’s feeling badly. line:20% Secondly, it reminds the bully to act nicer. line:20% It can be hard to stand up to bullies, line:20% but if we see someone getting picked on, we should help them. position:80% line:20% When we see bullying: position:80% line:20% Don’t be a silent bystander. position:80% line:20% be an upstander. position:80% line:20% Speak up when you see mean behavior. position:80% line:20% Calmly support the person who’s being bullied position:80% line:20% by saying a short phrase such as: position:80% line:20% “No need to be mean.” position:80% line:20% “Come on, let’s be nice.” position:80% line:20% “That’s not cool.” position:80% line:20% or “Why’d you say that?” position:80% line:20% Tell a teacher, parent, or adult if it happens again. position:80% line:20% Let’s see what happens when we do or don’t act like an Upstander. Shay: Hey Andy, Natalie, come over here. We’re gonna do the race again. Andy: But what about Niko? Shay: Well... We gotta see if we can get to level 8 today. He'd mess it up. Niko: He didn’t let me play last time either. line:20% Was Andy a bystander or an upstander? line:20% He was a silent bystander. line:20% Let’s see how this made everyone feel. line:20% Niko: Shay is always trying to get people not to play with me. line:20% It makes me feel so bad. line:20% Andy: I know Niko’s feelings were hurt, but I was too scared to speak up. line:20% It was just easier to go along with Shay. Niko is feeling hurt because Shay bullies him every day and no one stands up for him. It takes courage to stand up for others and be an upstander. Andy didn’t have the courage this time and felt badly about it. Let’s watch Andy try again. Shay: Hey Andy, Natalie, come over here. We’re gonna do that race again. Andy: (inner monologue) It’s not nice to treat Niko like that. If I speak up, Shay will know that we don’t like how he’s acting. Andy: Shay, no need to be mean. Andy: We can play ourselves. Niko: Okay! line:20% Was Andy a bystander or an upstander? line:20% Andy was being an upstander. line:20% How do you think Niko felt this time around? line:20% Let’s see what everyone was thinking this time. line:20% Niko: Andy made me feel so much better. line:20% I’m glad someone stood up for me. line:20% Andy: I was a little scared to say something, line:20% but it wasn’t nice to leave Niko out. line:20% I'm glad I decided to stand up for him. line:20% Shay: I didn’t want to be mean. I just wanted to win. line:20% Now I feel embarrassed. Andy made Niko feel supported when he stood up to Shay. It might feel scary to speak up, but it’s important that we support the right way to treat others and stand up to bullies. Be an Upstander. So, what did we learn? Don’t be a silent bystander, be an upstander. Speak up when you see mean behavior.

When we talk to someone in person, we can see their facial expressions and hear their tone of voice. We don't have these clues when we text someone so we may misunderstand what their messages actually mean. We don't know what the other person is thinking or feeling when they send them. To help us, we need to use our Cyber Skills. Our Cyber Skills are important so we don't make others feel upset or uncomfortable. They also help us figure out tricky texting situations. Our Cyber Skills for texting include: There's a time and a place for texting. We think about what we're going to say before we say it. We stop to think about the messages, and if we feel confused, we ask what they mean. Let's see what happens when text messages get confusing. Leah: I forgot what the homework was for tonight. Can you send it to me? Serena: You always forget the homework! Leah: Can you let me know what it is? Serena: Yup, I can... Leah: Nevermind. Serena: What? Leah: Why wouldn't you just help me? Serena: I will! I was just joking around. Leah: Just forget it. Serena: I was just kidding! Leah didn't use her Cyber Skills. Let's see how this made them both feel. Serena: Why is Leah so mad? I was just joking around. Leah: I'm so confused. Why won't Serena help me? I usually know the homework. I just forgot to write down the page numbers. Leah was getting upset because Serena wasn't giving her the homework information. She couldn't understand why her friend called her a name and it made her feel bad. Serena didn't understand why Leah was getting so upset. They had a miscommunication. When we can't see someone's face or hear their tone of voice, it can be really hard to figure out how they're feeling. Let's watch what happens if Leah and Serena have that same conversation face to face. Leah: I forgot what the homework was. Can you send it to me? Serena: You always forget the homework. Leah: Can you just send it to me? Serena: Yup, I can. Leah: Come on! Serena: The homework is pages 112 to 114 in the workbook. Leah: Okay, thanks. That time, we saw that Leah didn't have any trouble understanding Serena. Leah knew that Serena was just joking around when she wouldn't say the homework at first. It was easier for Leah to tell when she could see Serena's body language and hear her tone of voice. Over text messages, it was more confusing. If we are ever confused by text messages, we should: Stop. Think about the situation. Ask a question so we understand. Now, let's watch and see what happens when Leah does use her Cyber Skills. Leah: I forgot what the homework was for tonight. Can you send it to me? Serena: You always forget the homework! Leah: Can you let me know what it is? Serena: Yup, I can... Leah: Nevermind. Serena: What? Leah: I should think about these messages because I'm confused. Is Serena being mean? Or maybe she's just joking. It's hard to tell because I can't see her face or hear her voice. Maybe I'll ask what she means. Are you being serious? Serena: No, I'm just kidding. The homework is pages 112 to 114 in the workbook. Leah: Okay, thanks! Hope it doesn't take too long. Serena: It won't take long. It took me 15 minutes. Leah: Thanks! Talk to you later. Serena: Bye! That time, Leah was able to avoid the problem when she stopped to think about the messages and asked Serena what she meant. This helped her understand Serena's messages so she didn't become upset. Text messages can be tricky. There are many times when our messages can be misunderstood. If we are confused, we need to stop right away and use our Cyber Skills.

During this activity, you’ll try to figure out how people are going to react in different situations. After each video, you’ll get three choices. Then, you have to guess which one of those choices is going to happen next! This video is all about Compromising. Compromising is giving up part of what you want to allow someone to have part of what they want. This solves problems quickly and keeps everyone happy. It’s more important to consider others’ happiness than it is to always get what we want. In order to compromise: Expect to get what you want some of the time, but not all of the time. Figure out what part of your plan you’re giving up and what part you’re getting. Suggest a compromise with words like: “Why don’t we…” “How about we…” “What if we…” After each clip, you’ll have to decide what the characters should do to compromise. While watching, ask yourself: Is the character giving up part of what they want? What could they have done differently? Whenever you see this icon in the corner, stop to answer the questions about the situation you just watched. Let’s get started! In this video, we’ll focus on Shay. Shay: Yes! Natalie: That was a good game. Wanna play again? Shay: Uh... we don't have time. Indoor recess is over in five minutes. Natalie: Let’s change the rules to make it go faster. It will be like a speed round. We can take three cards instead of one. Shay: I... I don’t think so... I like playing the regular way. What do you think Shay should do? Let’s see if he compromises. Shay will... Tell Natalie he won’t play the new way. Compromise and agree to try the new rules. Clean up the game since indoor recess is almost over. Shay: Well... otherwise, we won’t have time to play. I guess we can try changing the rules. Natalie: Okay! Let’s play! Shay was able to compromise with Natalie and play the game using the new rules. Why do you think Shay compromised? At first, Shay did not want to accept Natalie’s idea. Did you notice what strategy Shay used to give himself time to think about a compromise with Natalie? Shay took a deep breath to keep his mind and body calm before making a decision. That gave him time to consider Natalie’s feelings. He realized that compromising would allow them to play another round of the game, making everyone happy. Can you think of a time in your life when compromising made others feel happy? In this video, we’ll focus on Chris. Chris: Hey Alessandra, wanna play with us? We need four players to play. Alessandra: Oh, I can’t. I have to go study. Chris: Come on, please? Alessandra: I really shouldn’t. I have work to do. Chris: Come on, we can’t play without you! What do you think Chris should do? Let’s see if he is able to compromise. Chris will... Convince Alessandra to play. Accept no for an answer. Get upset when he does not get his way. Bobby: Chris, come on. We can make it work with three people. Chris: No, we need four players to play! Chris could not accept no for an answer and got upset when his friend suggested a helpful compromise. How do you think everyone in this group is feeling? They’re feeling annoyed and confused by Chris’ outburst. Chris did not do a good job of compromising with his friends. He continued to ask Alessandra to play even after she already had told him no. Can you think of a compromise that would have given Chris part of what he wanted? In this round, we’ll focus on Shay. Shay: Alright... We should figure out our Halloween costumes. Niko: Definitely! We should go as something with three characters, so that we all can go together. Andy: Yeah, let's go something scary. We can paint our faces or put on masks. Niko: Yeah, let’s do it! I have a werewolf mask. Shay: Guys... I got it! Let’s be a band. We could have guitars and spiky hair. Niko: I don’t really know if I have the clothing for a band. Andy: Yeah, and I don’t really want to carry around an instrument. What do you think Shay should do? Let’s see if he can compromise with his friends. Shay will... Stop and think about how he could make a compromise. Find other people to go along with his costume idea. Tell his friends their idea is lame. Shay: (inner voice) No one agrees with my idea. I really wanted a band costume. I have been disagreeing with them lately. If I agree with them, I’ll have a group to go trick or treating with. Shay: Okay... we could be scary costumes. Andy: Awesome! Niko: Awesome! This is going to be so fun. Who do you guys want to go as? Shay: I’ll be Dracula! Andy: I’ll be a skeleton. Niko: I’ll be a werewolf! Shay was able to stop and think about a compromise that would make everyone happy in the group. He realized that he can’t always get what he wants. What did Shay give up? What did he still get? Shay realized he still would get to trick-or-treat with his friends, which was more important than getting his way. They were able to agree on a costume and Shay even got to pick his choice first. Today, we saw how we can compromise with others. We learned how giving up part of what we want helps everyone in the group. We watched how to: Compromise with others when playing a game. Accept no for an answer and suggest a compromise instead. Compromise with friends when agreeing to an idea. When compromising: Expect to get what you want some of the time, but not all of the time. Figure out what part of your plan you’re giving up and what part you’re getting. Use words like: “Why don’t we…” “How about we…” “What if we…” Remember, it’s more important to consider others’ happiness than it is to always get what we want. "," Welcome to Guess What Happens Next. During this activity, you’ll try to figure out how people are going to react in different situations. After each video, you’ll get three choices. Then, you have to guess which one of those choices is going to happen next! This video is all about Compromising. Compromising is giving up part of what you want to allow someone to have part of what they want. This solves problems quickly and keeps everyone happy. It’s more important to consider others’ happiness than it is to always get what we want. In order to compromise: Expect to get what you want some of the time, but not all of the time. Figure out what part of your plan you’re giving up and what part you’re getting. Suggest a compromise with words like: “Why don’t we…” “How about we…” “What if we…” After each clip, you’ll have to decide what the characters should do to compromise. While watching, ask yourself: Is the character giving up part of what they want? What could they have done differently? Whenever you see this icon in the corner, stop to answer the questions about the situation you just watched. Let’s get started! In this video, we’ll focus on Shay. Shay: Yes! Natalie: That was a good game. Wanna play again? Shay: Uh... we don't have time. Indoor recess is over in five minutes. Natalie: Let’s change the rules to make it go faster. It will be like a speed round. We can take three cards instead of one. Shay: I... I don’t think so... I like playing the regular way. What do you thi",0.8997229545

Sometimes when we were expecting outdoor recess, we have to have indoor recess. Sometimes we have a substitute teacher when we were expecting our regular teacher. To help us deal with change, we can use an Open Mind. An Open Mind says yes to new ideas or changes. This helps us try new things. Remember that an Open Mind has an important job to do. It has to stay calm while we try something new. Then, we can consider the new idea. Our Open Mind sees that we’ll stay safe trying the new way, and we tell ourselves it will be ok. The opposite of an Open Mind is a Closed Mind. A Closed Mind won’t let in anything new, but this isn’t good for us. A Closed Mind makes us feel worried and upset when we don’t need to be. Every time we try a new way, we’re growing more mature and capable. These are good things to be! In school, an Open Mind keeps us calm the whole day so we can handle changes our teachers or friends ask us to make. When we use our Open Mind, we: Pick a calming strategy. Open Minds think best when we’re calm. Use Self-talk. Telling yourself, “I can try new things with my Open Mind.” Use your Open Mind to picture doing the new way in your head. Agree to try it. You might say to someone, “Ok, I’ll try it,” or you might just think it. Let’s see what keeping an Open Mind in school looks like. Andy: Oh no! Our teacher isn’t here today! This is the worst! The substitute doesn’t do the same things my teacher does. They don’t say the same things. Andy: I can’t do this! If my teacher isn’t here, then I can’t be in here. Teacher: Good morning, everyone. I’m Mr. Waggner. I’m going to be your substitute for the day. We're going to start off the day by taking attendance, and then we're going to kick it off right into reading together. Andy: What? That’s never how we start the day! We go over the schedule and then we do silent reading. This is the worst day ever! Teacher: Niko? Niko: Here. Teacher: Madison? Madison: Here. Teacher: Shay? Shay: Here. Andy: This isn’t my teacher’s way of taking attendance! I can’t take this for another second! Teacher: Andy? Andy: I don’t have to do any of this! You’re not even our real teacher! Teacher: Okay, Andy, I’m going to have to write down your name so your teacher knows how you behaved when she was away. Andy is upset. His classmates are annoyed with his behavior. And he might be punished when his teacher returns. Let's see what others are thinking. Madison: Why does Andy always act this way? Andy: I can’t be in school today! My teacher isn’t here and everything will be horrible. Teacher: Why is Andy so upset? We haven’t even started the day yet. Andy did not use an Open Mind when he dealt with a change. He got upset with the change instead of staying calm. This was using a Closed Mind. An Open Mind makes things a lot easier. Andy’s day is different now, so he’s going to need to walk himself through some important steps so he can try something new. Let’s watch Andy use his Open Mind. Andy: Oh no! Our teacher isn’t here today! This is the worst! The substitute doesn’t do the same things my teacher does. They don’t say the same things. Andy: Wait... wait. This panic feeling is the one I get when I have a Closed Mind. I need to use an Open Mind. Teacher: Good morning, everyone. I’m Mr. Waggner. I’m going to be your substitute for the day. We're going to start off the day by taking attendance, and then we're going to kick it off right into reading together. Andy: We never read together after attendance! I cannot deal with someone who doesn’t know what they’re doing. Wait... if I’m getting this mad, that’s my clue that I don’t have an Open Mind yet. Okay, first, I calm down. Deep breaths help me. Teacher: Madison? Madison: Here. Teacher: Shay? Shay: Here. Andy: I can try new things. I’ll picture myself in this new situation. This sub is going to... teach. I will sit here. I’ll listen. I’ll probably watch. Yeah, I can do that. I’ll be okay. Teacher: Maggie? Maggie: Here. Teacher: Andy? Andy: Here. Teacher: Alright, let's get started. I’ll start by reading the first chapter. Let’s see how everyone felt when Andy kept an Open Mind. Madison: I like when the whole group is quiet and follows what the teacher says. It makes me happy and relaxed. Andy: This isn’t what we usually do, but even though I’m a little uncomfortable, it’s important to have an Open Mind. It's not all bad. All I have to do is sit here and that’s actually pretty easy. Teacher: This class has been really well-behaved. I know it's difficult when your routine has been disturbed. That time, Andy was able to use an Open Mind to stay calm when he had a change in his day. He used a calming strategy by taking deep breaths. Then, he pictured himself doing the new way and told himself he’d try it. It felt a little uncomfortable at first, but Andy was a lot more successful when he kept an Open Mind rather than a closed one. So, what did we learn? Our Open Mind helps us stay calm and try new things. First, we pick a calming strategy. Open Minds think best when we’re calm. Next, use Self-talk. Telling yourself, “I can try new things with my Open Mind.” Then, use your Open Mind to picture doing the new way in your head. Last, agree to try it.

The same strategy isn’t going to be the best to use every time, so we can think of more than one and pick the best one for right now. To help you figure out the best strategy for different moments, use the Self-Controller scanner: Scan your brain and body to see: Am I paying attention? Do I know what everyone is talking about it? How am I feeling? Do I feel calm and neutral or am I feeling a bigger emotion? What can I do to get myself ready and back in control? Ask do I need a break? Am I hungry or thirsty? What physical actions will help me calm down? The skills we use to activate our Self-Controller Scanner are: Scan your brain and body to figure out when you are losing control.

I don’t want to lose credit on my homework because I know I did it! This feels so bad! Teacher: Eric needed to calm down. He had a small problem but was very disruptive to the class. He should have handled it in a different way. Eric didn’t recognize that he was starting to lose control of his emotions. His reaction to the problem was too big. He was yelling out and banging on his desk. This was a small problem. Instead of getting out of control, Eric could have stopped to realize how he felt and figured out what he needed to help him stay in control. Now, let’s see what it looks like when Eric uses his Self-Controller Scanner to help him stay in control. Teacher: Good morning, everyone. I’d like you to turn in the homework from last night. Eric: Oh no. I forgot to bring in my homework. I must have left it at home! I’m starting to feel upset. I’ll scan my brain and body with my Self-Controller scanner to try and calm down. Am I paying attention? Do I know what everyone is talking about? Yes, it’s time to turn in our homework and I don’t have mine. How am I feeling? Do I feel calm and neutral or am I feeling a bigger emotion? I’m starting to feel sweaty and my heart is beating fast. I’m feeling a big emotion. I’m really anxious and angry that I did my homework but I left it at home. I might be losing control. What can I do to get myself ready and back in control? I could ask for a break, get a snack, or squeeze my hands together. I don’t want to leave class and I don’t want a snack right now. But it does help me when I squeeze my hands together. Squeezing my hands together helped me take a minute to calm down. This isn’t a big problem. I will tell my teacher that I did the homework, but I forgot it. Teacher: Yes, Eric? Eric: I did my homework, but I left it at home. Teacher: Okay. You can turn it in tomorrow. But remember, homework is always due the next day. Teacher: Eric did a nice job keeping self-control. I’m proud of him for working through his problem. Eric was able to use his Self-Controller Scanner to recognize how he felt. First, he realized that he was feeling a big emotion. He scanned his body to notice that he felt anxious and upset about his homework. Next, he thought of some strategies he could use to help him calm down. He picked squeezing his hands as what he needed in the moment. That way, he was able to keep control and work out a solution to his problem with his teacher.

What are some things that help you make responsible decisions?,Solving a Problem,,,,,,https://res.cloudinary.com/everyday-speech/raw/upload/v1619186997/SubtitlesVTT/SEL29_Making_Good_Decisions.vtt," It is estimated that the average person makes close to one million decisions in their lifetime! That's a lot of decisions. As we get older, we are faced with bigger, more complex decisions. This includes decisions that involve: our relationships with others, our future, and issues about right versus wrong. With practice, we can learn how to make this process less of a struggle, even when we are faced with difficult decisions. Making good decisions often seems easier said than done. We usually want to do the right thing, but how do we really know what is right or what is best? Some strategies to help us become better decision-makers include: Stop and Think When we stop and think, it helps us identify the choices we have in front of us. We need time to think about each choice. We often pick the wrong decision when we forget to slow down and think it through. Think of options Ask, 'What are my options?' When we consider all of the options, we think through our choices before we pick one. Think about what would be best for you now and in the future. Avoid peer pressure Once we pick a choice, we ask ourselves, ""Why do I want to do this?"" Are we making a decision because we feel pressured by our friends? It's never a good idea to do something just because someone else tells you to. Talk through how you could use each step to make a good decision if you had this issue: One of your best friends starts stealing things when you go to stores. You don't want to tell on them, but you don't want to get caught with them either. Next, we're going to talk about even more ways to become expert decision-makers. One of the toughest parts of trying to make a good decision is not knowing the exact outcome. We can hypothesize or try to imagine what will happen. It's normal to feel anxious or less than confident in these situations. The important thing is that we took the time first to stop, think, and plan before making a decision. Sometimes, we may use these strategies, but still feel overwhelmed or unsure of what decision to make. When this happens, it's okay to turn to a teacher, parent, or counselor for support. Watch out for decision traps These are things that negatively influence our ability to make good decisions, like when we're feeling hungry, tired, or upset. These feelings can cloud our judgment. Make sure to feel relaxed and calm before making a big decision. Commit to your decision Once we come to a decision, it's important to follow through with it. If we decide to try out for a play, we should dedicate the time and energy to follow through with that decision. That may mean practicing before auditions or surrounding yourself with people who support your decision. Remember not to let peer pressure sway you from the decision you've made, especially if it's important to you. Next time we are faced with a tough decision, try using the statement: I am making this decision because ____. We should fill that blank with something like: Because this is important to me. Because it makes me feel good. Because this aligns with my values. Positive feelings Making good decisions not only makes us feel more confident and successful, but makes the adults in our life feel proud of us, too. DISCUSSION: Think about a time when you made a poor decision. Which decision-making strategy would have helped you make a better decision in that situation? How can peer pressure be negative and how can we try to avoid it? Why is it important to follow through with a decision?

We can show respect by thinking about the way our voice sounds, our tone of voice, and the words we use. Sometimes it's more respectful to disagree in an indirect way. This means we talk around it rather than saying it directly. Let's see what it looks like when Leah is disrespectful when disagreeing with her teacher. Teacher: In our next unit, we're going to be reading some poems by the most famous American poet, Robert Frost. Yes, Leah? Leah: Actually Emily Dickinson is the most famous American poet. She wrote over 1,800 poems. Teacher: Well, that's a matter of opinion, but there are many important and influential poets. Leah: Why would we waste our time reading Frost poems? He's not even good. Teacher: You might disagree, but now is not the time to state your opinion. How was Leah disrespectful when she disagreed with her teacher? And how did that make her classmates feel? Let's see what they're thinking. Justin: I think Leah's going to get detention. Rachel: I can't believe she's talking to our teacher like that. Leah's classmates feel shocked by how she spoke to her teacher. Leah told her teacher she was wrong and then expressed her dislike of the class material.

I think so because she has so many poems. Teacher: I would say she's a very famous and important poet. We're going to be reading poems from her and a few others too. Let's start on page 66. Leah was able to state her own opinion which differed from her teacher's, but this time she said it in a respectful way. She changed the word she used from telling her teacher to asking her teacher. This was a more indirect way to express her thoughts. The way we say things can make a big difference. So next time you disagree with an adult, make sure to be respectful. Using an indirect way of speaking sounds more respectful rather than disagreeing directly."," There are lots of times we might disagree with others. That's okay as long as we show respect.

There are two different kinds of brain breaks: Energizing Breaks and Relaxing Breaks. Energizing brain breaks happen when we move around and give our brains oxygen. This wakes up a tired or bored brain. Jumping, dancing, or stretching exercises are great energizing brain breaks. Calming brain breaks happen when we concentrate on only one thing and ignore other distractions. Breathing exercises like box breathing work great to make our brain only think about one simple thing. We think about just our breathing to make our concentration stronger for everything. Sometimes, classes will take brain breaks together, but we can also do brain breaks on our own whenever we need them. Here are some you can do on your own that don’t need space or permission: Write the alphabet with your finger or toe. Tap each of your fingers to your thumb, then back again. Crawl one hand up your back while one hand crawls down your back. Try to make the fingers from each of your hands touch. In your seat, stretch your arms way above your head, stretching every muscle in your back and belly. Teachers, you can pause here to discuss this list with your students, give examples, or gather new ideas. In the next part of the video, we’ll practice each brain break. Let’s practice four of the brain breaks. Write the alphabet or trace shapes with your big toe by moving it inside of your shoe. Start... now. Now, tap each of your fingers to your thumb, then back again. Start... now. Next, reach your hand up your back while the other hand reaches down your back. Can you get your fingers from each hand to touch? Start... now. Last, staying in your seat, stretch your arms way above your head, stretching every muscle in your back and belly and making them long. Stretch up as high as you can. Now, just go an inch further and relax with a deep breath. DISCUSSION: When are the times in your day a brain break would be helpful?

Throughout the day, we find ourselves in many different situations. It’s important that our actions fit each situation. To help us figure out how to act, we tune in and observe what others are doing. We change the way we behave depending on where we are and who is there. The skills you need to be a Social Chameleon are: Tune In to our surroundings – observe where we are and who is there. Read People’s Moods and try to see how others are feeling. Adjust our actions to fit in with the time and place. Let’s see what happens when Zack isn’t a Social Chameleon. Cole: Ugh!

In this video, we're going to decide if it's the right time and place for the action. If we act in a way that doesn't match the time or place, we can make others feel uncomfortable or upset. To make sure our actions match the time and place, we can: Think about what's going on right now. Think about where we are. And think about who we're talking to. Every time we see this icon in the corner, we should stop and discuss what happened. How does everyone feel? Why? Let's get started. In this video, Zach is answering a question from his teacher. Let's focus on the time and place for his words. Zach: Ms. Lehane, these problems are mad hard. Teacher: Oh, are they? Zach: Yeah, bae. Did Zach choose the right time and place to speak the way he did? Zach DID NOT choose the best time and place. We should match our words to where we are. In this case, Zach was in class and talking to his teacher. So it wasn't the right time to use slang words. When we're talking to teachers, we should be respectful and use more formal language than we use with our friends. When is a time we could use slang and another time we shouldn't? When Madison says ""What's up?"" to Connor, he tells her all about his day. Watch to see if Connor chooses the best time and place for his answers. Madison: Hey Connor, what's up? Connor: I am having the luckiest day ever. First, I found $20 in my pocket. I'm super excited because I'm saving up for a new game. Then, I was supposed to have a quiz in Science, but the fire alarm rang so we won't have it until tomorrow. This gives me way more time to study. Madison: Wow! That's... really lucky. Connor: I know! I didn't have much time to study for Science last night, but I'm totally free tonight. I wonder what else will happen today. Maybe I should play the lottery and I'll win big! Madison: Oh, uh... alright. What do you think was the right time and place for a long conversation? Connor didn't choose the right time and place to give such long answers. When someone asks you ""What's up?"" they usually think that you'll give them a short answer. Saying ""What's up"" is just another way to say hello. In this situation, we shouldn't tell them everything we're thinking about. How would your answer to the question ""What's up?"" change in these three scenarios? You are hanging out at a friend's house, and they ask ""What's up?"" You see someone you only know a little bit in the hallway, and they ask ""What's up?"" You are on the phone with your parents, and they ask ""What's up?"" This time, we'll focus on Leah telling Rachel some news. Think about if it's the best time and place for this. Rachel: Hey, is everything okay? Leah: I'm not having a good day. Rachel: What happened? Leah: My brother's in the hospital. Rachel: Oh, no! Is he going to be alright? Leah: He should be fine. I'm just worried. Thanks. Leah told Rachel some heavy news there. Do you think she chose the right time and place? Leah DID choose the right time and place. Leah told Rachel in private. Rachel is Leah's friend, so Leah told her more personal information than she would tell someone she didn't know well. Medical information about our families is private so we need to be careful about the time and place we tell people about it. This usually is best for private conversations with our close family and friends. The group just got their test back. Let's see if Rachel chooses the right time and place to talk about how she did on the test. Justin: How did you guys do on that last test? I didn't do so well. Leah: Me either. I think I'm going to have to study a lot more for the next one. Rachel: Yeah, it was hard. Justin: Want to go study? Leah: Sure. Justin: See you later. Zach: So, how did you do? I know you're pretty good with Biology. Rachel: Well... I got an A. Zach: Wow! That test was really hard. Rachel: Thanks! Rachel told Zach that she got an A. Did she choose the right time and place? Rachel DID choose the right time and place. Rachel could have bragged in front of the whole group about how she did on the test. But she noticed that everyone else struggled with the test. She was modest and she said that the test was hard. Justin: How did you guys do on that last test? I didn't do so well. Leah: Me either. I think I'm going to have to study a lot more for the next one. Rachel: Yeah, it was hard. Being modest means we don't make a big deal about things we do well. Rachel was happy with her grade, but she waited until Zach asked her in private and answered Zach's question respectfully. In front of the group wouldn't have been the right time and place, so she waited. In this video, we'll focus on Justin during class. We'll see if he picks a good time and place for his behavior or not. Justin: Man, my face is really itching me. I can't stand it anymore! But, if I want to pick out my face, I shouldn't do it in front of anyone. Excuse me? Can I go to the bathroom? Justin wanted to pick at his face. Did he choose the right time and place? Justin DID choose the right time and place. Justin realized that picking and itching his face in the middle of the class might have made his classmates feel uncomfortable. That wasn't the right time and place. So he excused himself and went to the bathroom. When we're dealing with personal hygiene, being in public isn't the best place to handle those issues. We should try to go to a bathroom, so we can be in private. If there are other people in the bathroom, which happens in school sometimes, we can go into a bathroom stall by ourselves to make sure we're really in private. Great job, everyone! We learned a lot about finding the best time and place for our actions. Some examples of not choosing the best time and place were: Using slang words when talking to your teacher and giving a really long answer to a simple question. Some of our characters did choose the best time and place like: When Leah told Rachel about her private family concerns, or when Rachel didn't brag about her grades in front of the group. What did we learn? To make sure we pick the right time and place for our actions, we can: Think about what's going on right now. Think about where we are. Think about who we're talking to. Remember to think about your actions and if it's the best time and place for them. Thanks for watching! "," - Welcome to Two Sides, a game where we compare how people act in different situations. In this video, we're going to decide if it's the right time and place for the action. If we act in a way that doesn't match the time or place, we can make others feel uncomfortable or upset. To make sure our actions match the time and place, we can: Think about what's going on right now. Think about where we are. And think about who we're talking to. Every time we see this icon in the corner, we should stop and discuss what happened. How does everyone feel? Why? Let's get started. In this video, Zach is answering a question from his teacher. Let's focus on the time and place for his words. Zach: Ms. Lehane, these problems are mad hard. Teacher: Oh, are they? Zach: Yeah, bae. Did Zach choose the right time and place to speak the way he did? Zach DID NOT choose the best time and place. We should match our words to where we are. In this case, Zach was in class and talking to his teacher. So it wasn't the right time to use slang words. When we're talking to teachers, we should be respectful and use more formal language than we use with our friends. When is a time we could use slang and another time we shouldn't? When Madison says ""What's up?"" to Connor, he tells her all about his day. Watch to see if Connor chooses the best time and place for his answers. Madison: Hey Connor, what's up? Connor: I am having the luckiest day ever. First, I found $20 in my pocket. I'm super excited because I'm s",0.3809801386

The first step to understanding body language is being a good observer. This means using our eyes to look or read someone’s body language. We try to notice: A person’s body position - Did they lean in and get closer to you or move away? Are their shoulders slumped or are they standing up straight? Their arms and hands - Are they crossed, open, or relaxed by their side? Their eyes - Are they making eye contact while you talk or looking around the room? And their facial expression - Focus on their eyes, eyebrows, and mouth. Are they smiling? Do they look happy and interested in what you’re saying or bored? When we are a good observer, we notice other people’s body language. We can tell if they are enjoying the conversation, or if they are thinking about something else. Once we notice these clues, we decide how to act. If someone is turned away from us, has their arms crossed, and is looking around the room, how do you think they feel? They probably feel bored. That tells you that you should change the topic or maybe end the conversation. If someone is facing their body towards you, nodding their head, making eye contact, and smiling while you talk, how do you think they feel? They probably feel happy and interested in the conversation. That tells you that you can keep talking! To read someone’s body language, you: First, use your eyes to look for clues.

New friendships take time and effort. That’s why it’s important to stop and think before we start a friendship. Is this person a good fit for me? We should look for friends who have common interests, take the same classes, or have a similar sense of humor. Often, we form friendships with others based on shared experiences. This could be having classes together, participating in the same clubs or sports, or family friendships. As we’re choosing a friend, we want one with a personality that fits with ours. Friends who suit us well usually have similar behavior in school. Good friends don’t get us into trouble and they treat adults and peers like we do. Close friends aren’t necessarily the same as us in every way. It’s okay to have different personalities, clothes, or backgrounds as long as we have some things in common.

We look for someone who: Makes us feel comfortable Has similar behavior Has shared experiences with us Isn’t the exact same, but fits with us, or gets us We do this so that our friendly efforts will be for the right people.

You guys could come over! Logan: Um, well... Actually, I think I’m busy. Isaac: Yeah, I can’t. Sorry. Julian: Oh, okay. This didn't go very well for Julian, but we aren't sure why.

I don’t even know Julian. Isaac: This is the first time Julian and I have ever talked in school. It was pretty awkward to get invited to his house. Julian: Why didn’t Isaac and Logan want to hang out with me? Julian didn’t think about who has similar interests, who shares experiences with him, or who fits in with him. He invited Isaac and Logan over without putting in the time to get to know them. This made Logan and Isaac feel uncomfortable. Let’s see what happens when he thinks about who’d be a good fit for him before he makes an effort. Logan: It's going to be so hot this weekend. Isaac: Yeah, and my house doesn't have AC either. Julian: I want to make more friends at school. I like Logan and Isaac, but I haven’t talked to them much. Who'd be a good fit for me? Jackson and I have a lot in common and we talk a lot at school. I could invite him over. Julian: Hey Jackson, what are you doing this weekend? Jackson: Um, nothing much. Julian: Do you want to come over? Jackson: Sure. What do you wanna do? Julian: We could play video games. Jackson: That sounds fun. What was different this time? Why do you think Jackson was interested in hanging out with Julian? Let’s see what they were thinking. Jackson: I’m excited to hang out with Julian. Julian: It’s important to think about who would be a good fit for me, before I start putting in time and effort with people.

How can being distracted negatively affect you?,Meditation Videos,,,,,,https://res.cloudinary.com/everyday-speech/raw/upload/v1619186994/SubtitlesVTT/SEL05_Keeping_Focus.vtt," Improving our focus means we can pay attention for a long time without getting distracted by something else. We can check our focus by paying attention to how well we are thinking. Ask yourself: Am I alert? Am I working slowly? Am I daydreaming? Am I distracted by things around me? Am I trying to do two things at once? Teachers, you can pause here to discuss this with your students. Once we understand our focus, we can do certain things to improve it. If we aren’t alert, we should make a plan to go to bed earlier. Our brains need sleep to run quickly. If we are working slowly and things are taking a long time to do, try taking a short brain break. We can empty our minds for a few minutes so that our brains recharge. Short breaks can help you get more done because it brings your focus back to a high level. If we realize we are daydreaming, we can practice being mindful. This means we only think about what is happening right now, not past memories or tomorrow. Try taking a few slow, deep breaths and only think about your breathing. This lets your brain ignore other things. If you are distracted by things around you, how can you clear your space? Do you need less stuff around you, the TV off, or headphones that block noise? It saves you time to make a space that helps you focus. If you notice you are trying to do two things at once, only do one thing. We actually can’t do two things at once. We can only pay attention to one thing at a time. All this switching makes our brain tired. Let’s practice thinking about our focus. First, picture a task like math or writing. How do you lose your focus on tasks like these? Do you get tired, get distracted by things around you, or try to do other things at the same time? Group discussion: Can you name times you’d like to focus better? What strategy can help you focus during those times? How will you try to improve your attention? "," Improving our focus means we can pay attention for a long time without getting distracted by something else. We can check our focus by paying attention to how well we are thinking. Ask yourself: Am I alert? Am I working slowly? Am I daydreaming? Am I distracted by things around me? Am I trying to do two things at once? Teachers, you can pause here to discuss this with your students. Once we understand our focus, we can do certain things to improve it. If we aren’t alert, we should make a plan to go to bed earlier. Our brains need sleep to run quickly. If we are working slowly and things are taking a long time to do, try taking a short brain break. We can empty our minds for a few minutes so that our brains recharge. Short breaks can help you get more done because it brings your focus back to a high level. If we realize we are daydreaming, we can practice being mindful. This means we only think about what is happening right now, not past memories or tomorrow. Try taking a few slow, deep breaths and only think about your breathing. This lets your brain ignore other things. If you are distracted by things around you, how can you clear your space? Do you need less stuff around you, the TV off, or headphones that block noise? It saves you time to make a space that helps you focus.

We can’t see people’s feelings, but we can use the clues we see on the outside to guess their feelings on the inside. Once we know how someone feels, we’ll know the best thing to say or do in that moment. In order to read someone’s facial expression, we can remember to look at the Big Three: eyes, eyebrows, and mouth. These parts of the face show emotions the most. Lifted eyes, eyebrows, and mouths are all signs of positive feelings like happiness, pride, or interest. When eyes are lifted up to look wider, it’s a sign of a good feeling. Eyebrows that are lifted also mean positive feelings. The same is true for a mouth. The corners of the mouth are lifted in a smile. Lowered eyes, eyebrows, and mouths are all signs of negative feelings like sadness, frustration, or boredom. This could be eyes that look down, eyebrows that are pushed down, or a mouth that is frowning. We notice all three: eyes, eyebrows, and mouth, and decide if they are lifted or lowered, wide or pushed down. This helps us guess how someone’s feeling. To figure out how someone is feeling, we can use the Big Three. Eyes, eyebrows, and mouth are the Big Three that show the most feelings. Look at other's eyes, eyebrows, and mouths. Are they lifted or pushing down? Watch them closely to know how someone is feeling. Let’s see what using the Big Three looks like. Jayden: I have a stegosaurus, too. Probably three of those, just in my room. Jayden: My collection is complete. I just need a pterodactyl. I wonder how Tommy is feeling. I’ll use the Big Three to read his face and figure it out. He’s not looking at me anymore. He’s looking down and his eyebrows and mouth are lowered. He’s bored. I need to change the topic. So, have you seen any good movies lately? Tommy: Yeah! Last week, I watched a cool movie and my mom made popcorn! Jayden: Cool! Tell me all about it! Jayden was able to use the Big Three to figure out that Tommy felt bored. Let’s see another feeling. Stella: Hey, Nikki. What’s up? Nikki: Oh, hi. Stella: Hmm... How is Nikki feeling? I’ll use the Big Three to read her face to figure it out. Her eyes keep looking down, her eyebrows are kind of pushing down, and her mouth is turned down in a frown. I think she’s feeling sad. What’s wrong? Nikki: I didn’t get a solo in the musical. Stella: I’m sorry! What a bummer. You think being in the chorus will still be fun? Nikki: Yeah, it’ll still be fun. I’ll get over it. Stella did a great job of using the Big Three! She figured out that Nikki was feeling sad by reading her eyes, eyebrows, and mouth. When she realized that Nikki felt sad, she made a nice comment to cheer her up. Let’s see even more feelings. Nikki: Hey, Sam! Sam: Uh… hey… Nikki: I wonder how Sam is feeling. She’s not really looking at me. I’ll use the Big Three to read her face and figure it out. Her eyes are squinted, which is like lowered eyes. It must be a negative feeling. And her eyebrows are bunched together. Her mouth is frowning, too. I think she’s feeling frustrated. Do you need help with that? Those last three problems are tough ones. Sam: Thanks. This is super hard. Nikki used the Big Three to figure out that Sam felt frustrated. It was nice of Nikki to offer to help Sam. Let’s see one last feeling. Sam: That’s a cool lunchbox! Stella: Thanks! I just got it! Sam: I noticed Stella’s face changed when I talked about her lunchbox. I’m going to use the Big Three to figure out how she’s feeling. Her eyes got wider and her eyebrows are raised. Her mouth is smiling. I bet she’s interested in talking more about this. Where did you get it? Stella: My mom got it for me. Sam: Oh, I really like it. Sam could tell that Stella felt interested by looking at her wider eyes, raised eyebrows, and smiling mouth. It’s important to read other's faces so we can figure out how they feel. This helps us know how to react to their feelings. If we see that a friend looks sad, we can say something nice. If a friend looks frustrated, we can help them out. So, what did we learn? To figure out how someone is feeling, we can use the Big Three – the three parts of our face that show the most feelings: our eyes, eyebrows, and mouth. Eyes, eyebrows, and mouth are the Big Three that show the most feelings. Look at other's eyes, eyebrows, and mouths. Are they lifted or pushing down? Keep watching someone’s eyes, eyebrows, and mouth closely to know how someone is feeling. "," - Sometimes, it’s hard to know how someone else is feeling.

In a group, we use the same stoplight clues to help us know when we have the green light to start speaking. We listen for a short pause that tells us the person is finished talking. We listen for questions. And we look for a change in body language and eye contact that shows we’re expected to talk. Pauses can seem shorter in a group. Other people are waiting to jump in to talk, so another person might take the next opportunity to speak. We have to be ready with what we’re going to say when we hear a short pause. We do our planning during the yellow light of a Conversation Stoplight. We plan what we’re going to say while we watch and listen for green light clues. We still listen to other people while they’re talking, so we have to do both things at once! We don’t get as many chances to talk in a group. The group shares the talking time between all the members. If we accidentally talk over someone, it’s okay. We say, “Sorry, go ahead,” or “You can finish.” We use Conversation Stoplight in a group to help us know when to talk and when to listen. We have a red light while others are talking or about to talk. The Yellow Light is our time to plan what to say. We have to try not to talk over others. We listen and watch others’ faces and body language to know that we have the green light. Let’s see what happens as we try to use the Conversation Stoplight in a group. Anika: I watched the coolest cooking show last night. What’s the hardest thing you guys have ever tried to make? Kai: Hmm... probably macaroni and cheese. Niko: I don't really cook anything. Unless making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich counts? Anika: It doesn’t count unless you made the peanut butter. Niko: I definitely did not make the peanut butter. I did scoop it from the jar, though. Anika: A cake is probably the hardest thing I’ve ever had to make. Kai: From scratch or box? Anika: I made it from box, so I guess it’s not that hard. Niko: Now I want cake! What happened there? Emma had a hard time knowing when to jump in. She wasn’t able to successfully join the conversation. Let’s see how this made others feel. Anika: Emma didn’t talk to us much. I guess she didn't want to. Emma: I wanted to talk, but I didn’t know how to jump in. Emma didn't know when to join the conversation so she wasn't able to take turns talking. This made the rest of the group feel like she didn't want to talk to them. Let’s watch her use the Conversation Stoplight. Anika: I watched the coolest cooking show last night. What’s the hardest thing you guys have ever tried to make? Kai: Hmm... probably macaroni and cheese. Emma: Now seems like a good time to jump in. No one is talking right now. I can answer the question. Mine’s waffles. I made them from scratch, not the box kind. Niko: I don't really cook anything. Unless making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich counts? Anika: That doesn’t count unless you made the peanut butter. Niko: I definitely did not make the peanut butter. Anika: My toughest is probably cake. Kai: From box or scratch? Anika: I made it from box, so I guess it wasn't that hard. Emma: It’s still hard to make a whole cake. Niko: Now I want cake! Let’s see what the group is thinking about each other now. Anika: It was fun talking to this group. Emma and I both seem to like baking. Emma: I watched the group and waited for a pause in the conversation. This helped me know when I could join in. That time, Emma used the Conversation Stoplight to know when it was a good time for her to join in the conversation. She watched the group’s faces for clues and listened for pauses.

Friendships develop slowly over time. Each time you’re with a person or a group, you create more shared memories and learn more about each other. It might take months or years to develop a close friendship with someone. There are a few steps we can use to get closer with others. First, determine who you enjoy being around. Seek out a new friend by talking to people, finding common interests, and learning more about each other. The second step is to invite a friend to spend time with you during school. Think of this as a mini plan. You might make plans to eat at the same lunch table, do homework, or walk in the hall together. These mini plans in school are a short amount of time together. If you spend too much time together, it might feel overwhelming to the new friend. We take turns in new friendships. We wait for the other person to make a mini plan with us before we keep inviting them to do more. Third, suggest a plan outside of school. This lets the person know you think of them as more than just a friend at school. Plans outside of school could include inviting others to your house, or spending time doing something you both enjoy. Lastly, we keep communicating and sharing experiences over time. We keep in touch by messaging a few times a week. Friends don’t need to talk and hang out all the time, but they continue as the friendship grows. No one is perfect. If we make a mistake with a friend, we try our best to fix it so that we don’t lose the friend. This could mean apologizing or taking actions to understand how your friend is feeling. To build close friendships with others: Determine someone you enjoy being around and seek out times to talk to them. Start small by inviting a friend to spend time with you during school. If that goes well, make plans outside of school. Continue making plans and keeping in touch by talking inside and outside of school Remember, the more experiences you share, the closer friends you’ll become. Let’s see what happens if we don’t follow these steps. Isaac: Hey Logan, wait up! Logan: Hey! Isaac: That was a good presentation you just gave. Logan: Thank you. I was nervous. Isaac: I couldn’t tell. Logan: Oh good. Isaac: You’re on the school track team, right? Because I love running. Logan: Yeah. Why didn’t you try out for the team? Isaac: I don’t know. I was afraid I wouldn't make it. Logan: You really should have. We really need people. Isaac: Well, maybe we could run together sometime. We could get a group together after school. Logan: Um... yeah, maybe. Isaac: You and your friends could come by my house too. There’s a big track by my house. Logan: Um... Yeah, m-maybe. I really need to go to class. Isaac: Oh, okay. Did Isaac follow the steps to build a close friendship? How do you think everyone was feeling? Isaac: Why didn’t Logan want to come over after school? We both like running. Logan: That was so weird. That was the first time I ever talked to that kid and he invites the entire track team over to his house. Isaac didn’t realize that he made Logan uncomfortable when he made plans without getting to know him better. He missed two important steps: Getting to know someone, then making in-school plans together Let’s see what happens when he does follow the steps to build a close friendship. Isaac: Hey Logan, wait up! Logan: Hey! Isaac: That was a good presentation you just gave. Logan: Thank you. I was nervous. Isaac: I couldn’t tell. Logan: Oh good. Isaac: You’re on the school track team, right? Because I love running. Logan: Yeah. Why didn’t you try out for the team? Isaac: I don’t know. I was afraid I wouldn't make it. Logan: You should have. We really need people. Isaac: I want to hang out with Logan outside of school, but I need to get to know him better first. Well, maybe I’ll come to a meet sometime. Gotta run, see ya. Logan: See you later. Teacher: Okay, guys, let’s finish up this week’s vocab. You can choose to work with a partner or independently. Isaac: Hmm… who should I ask? I’m trying to get to know Logan better, so I’ll ask him. Isaac: Hey, Logan, do you want to be partners? Logan: Sure! Did you get the definitions yet? Isaac: No, I haven’t gotten there. Logan: Alright, we can do them together. Isaac: Hey, what are you doing Friday? My brother and I are going to the South Street Park. Do you want to come? Logan: Sure! How do you think Logan feels about Issac now? Let’s see what everyone was thinking. Logan: Isaac is a new friend. I'm glad he asked me to be his partner. This helped me get to know him better. Isaac: I had to get to know Logan better first in school. Now that we got to know each other, we can hang out outside of school! That time, Isaac got to know Logan better and decided he wanted to be friends. He first made some in-school plans before he invited him to do something outside of school. This made Logan feel more comfortable and want to become Isaac’s friend. The more time Isaac and Logan spend together, the closer friendship they’ll build. So, what did we learn? To build close friendships with others: Determine someone you enjoy being around and seek out times to talk to them. Start small by inviting a friend to spend time with you during school. If that goes well, make plans outside of school. Continue making plans and keeping in touch by talking inside and outside of school.

To figure out how someone is feeling, we use all the clues they give us. We focus on: Their facial expression - How do they look? Can we tell how they feel? Their tone of voice - how their voice sounds. And the words they say - What message do their words send? After we hear from each person, we’ll stop and discuss all of the clues that help us figure out what emotion they are feeling. Let’s get started! Watch Kiara and decide how she’s feeling. Kiara: My neighbor just got this huge dog. It barks so loud. I don’t want to walk past their house anymore. How does Kiara feel? Let’s start by looking at her facial expression. Can you tell how she feels? Now, let’s focus on her tone of voice. Kiara: My neighbor just got this huge dog. It barks so loud. I don’t want to walk past their house anymore. What emotion are you hearing? Does her voice go up or down? What about her words? What message was she sending? Kiara: My neighbor just got this huge dog. It barks so loud. I don’t want to walk past their house anymore. Did her words give us clues about how she feels about the dog? How do you think Kiara was feeling? Choose one of these emotions: Disappointed Frustrated Scared Guilty Kiara was feeling... Scared! We can tell she was feeling scared because of her facial expression. Her eyebrows were raised, her eyes were wide, and her mouth was not smiling. Kiara’s tone of voice sounded scared because her voice stayed low and flat the whole time. Lastly, her words told us that she didn’t want to go by the dog, so we can put ourselves in that situation and tell that she didn’t want to be near it. What is something that you’re scared of? How do you handle it? Watch Liz and decide how she’s feeling. Liz: I broke a vase in my house, but I didn’t tell my parents. I didn’t want to get in trouble. How did Liz feel? Let’s look at the clues: Let’s start by looking at her facial expression. Do you get any clues from her eyes, eyebrows, or mouth? Now let’s focus on her tone of voice.

Liz: I broke a vase in my house, but I didn’t tell my parents. I didn’t want to get in trouble. Liz told us that she broke a vase and didn’t tell her parents. How do you think Liz was feeling? Choose one of these emotions: Annoyed Bored Guilty Disappointed Liz was feeling... Guilty. We can tell she was feeling guilty because of her facial expression. Her eyebrows were scrunched down, her eyes were looking down, and her mouth was not smiling. Liz’s tone of voice sounded guilty because her voice was quieter than normal and her pitch was low and flat. Lastly, her words told us she didn’t tell her parents because she didn’t want to get in trouble. What do you think would have made Liz feel better? Watch Andy and decide how he’s feeling. Andy: My friend and I had a disagreement, but now that we cleared it up, I feel so much better. How did Andy feel? Let’s look at the clues: Let’s start by looking at his face. This time, listen to his tone of voice. Andy: My friend and I had a disagreement, but now that we cleared it up, I feel so much better. Is his voice high or low? Is he talking fast or slow? What about his words? Andy: My friend and I had a disagreement, but now that we cleared it up, I feel so much better. What message was he sending? How do you think Andy was feeling?

His face looked relaxed because he was smiling. His tone of voice sounded happy and rose up at the end of his sentence. Lastly, his words told us he was feeling much better now that he and his friend made up. What makes you feel calm? Watch Kiara and decide how she’s feeling. Kiara: My mom yelled at me in front of all my friends. It was awful. How did Kiara feel? Let’s look at the clues: How do you think her facial expression looks?

Before watching, ask your group what they do to make peace after they have argued with a friend or family member.",Handling Conflicts with Friends,,,,,,https://res.cloudinary.com/everyday-speech/raw/upload/v1619083080/SubtitlesVTT/PbXyD5FVNk_S227_Handling_Conflicts_with_Friends.vtt," - Disagreements or arguments with friends are called Conflicts. Conflicts with friends can happen from time to time and may make us feel upset or uncomfortable. When we solve the conflict or problem, everyone feels better and the friendship usually returns to normal. To handle conflicts with friends, we can use the Problem Solving Steps. The first step is to identify the problem. This means that we need to figure out what our problem is. Go back and try to think of what might have caused the conflict between you and your friend. Conflicts are almost always both people’s fault. Each person has done something wrong. Think first how you might have hurt your friend’s feelings. Next, think about how your friend hurt your feelings. Once you identify the cause of the conflict, next ask yourself, “Can I solve the problem by myself or do I need an adult?” The third step is to come up with at least two solutions to the problem. Many times, a conflict with a friend can be solved with a simple apology for whatever caused the disagreement. The fourth step is to think about what might happen if we tried each solution. Then, pick the best solution. Now, decide if the problem is solved. We know we have solved the problem if everyone feels better. To handle conflicts with friends, we: Identify the problem by figuring out what we did wrong and what the other person did wrong. Decide if you need help to solve this. Do we need adults to help us, or can we handle it by ourselves? Come up with multiple solutions to try. Decide which solution is best. Is an apology needed? Decide if we have solved the conflict. Let’s watch Andy handle a conflict with Niko. Niko: Hey, Andy. What’s up? Andy: Not much. I’m excited to hangout after class though. Niko: I can’t. Andy: What? Why? Niko: I made plans to go to the mall with my sister. Andy: Are you serious? Why would you hang out with your little sister? Niko: Hey, why are you being such a baby about this? Did Andy handle the conflict with Niko well? No, Andy did not. How do you think everyone is feeling? Andy: I can’t believe Niko canceled our plans like that. He didn’t even say sorry. Niko: I forgot I told Andy I could hang out today, but now he’s being such a jerk. I don’t want to hang out anymore. Andy and Niko both did something wrong. Niko hurt Andy’s feelings by changing plans. Andy then hurt Niko’s feelings by using an angry tone with him. This did not solve their problem. Let’s watch Andy and Niko try again. Niko: Hey, Andy. What’s up? Andy: Not much. I’m excited to hangout after class though. Niko: I can’t. Andy: What? Why? Niko: I made plans to go to the mall with my sister. Andy: Are you serious? Why would you hang out with your little sister? Niko: Andy seems upset. Did I say something to make him mad? He’s probably mad because I changed our plans. I can fix this problem myself. I could explain that I forgot about our plans, make new plans with him, or tell him I’m sorry. I’m going to apologize and see if we can make new plans next week. Niko: Hey man, I’m sorry. I forgot about our plans. Can we hang out next week? Andy: I overreacted here. Niko forgot about our plans, but I shouldn’t have yelled at him. Andy: Yeah, sorry I overreacted. I shouldn't have yelled at you. Niko: It’s okay. You can come over next week and we can play video games. Andy: Okay, deal. How did Andy and Niko solve their conflict this time? How do you think they’re feeling now? Andy: I’m glad we apologized to each other and went back to being friends. Niko: I’m glad that Andy and I are okay now. Saying sorry and suggesting new plans was a good way to solve our problem. Niko handled the conflict that time. He used the Problem Solving Steps to work through the conflict and come up with a solution. He noticed Andy was upset and identified the cause of the conflict. Then, he was able to think of a solution. Niko stayed calm and apologized to Andy for changing their plans unexpectedly. When he apologized, Andy thought about what he did wrong and apologized for his role in the conflict, too. They made new plans and both boys felt better. To handle conflicts with friends, we: Identify the problem by figuring out what we did wrong and what the other person did wrong. Decide if you need help to solve this.

His voice also sounded bored. Jeff should act like he’s interested, so he doesn’t hurt Kate’s feelings. How can he show he’s interested? By looking at Kate, facing her, and making comments about horseback riding. Jeff: What are you doing this weekend? Kate: I have a horseback riding lesson. I just started. It's so much fun. Jeff: I don’t like horseback riding. But Kate seems so excited. I don’t want to make her feel bad, so I’ll talk about that for a little bit. Cool! Where do you do that?

The most important thing about finding a good group is one that likes you for who you are. We want to be careful that our friend group never gangs up on us or is mean to us. Ganging up on someone means a group is working together to manipulate, trick, or tease a person. If friends are nice to us sometimes and then mean other times, it can be hard to know if they are really your friends. Good friends are nice to you all of the time. One way to tell a group is ganging up on someone is that they are laughing at them or keeping secrets from them. They might make the person do work to stay in the group like do their homework for them or leave recess early to save them a lunch seat. When a group is ganging up on you, they’re showing that they are not nice friends. You’ll want to get a teacher or parent’s advice to figure out what to do. How you’ve been treated will help you and an adult choose your options. An adult who cares about you will help you decide what’s best for you in this situation. One option is talking to the group so they see your side. Another option is leaving the group and not being friends with them anymore. A third option is changing who you are close with. You might be friends with some of the people in the group, but not all of the people. You might just hang out with the group in certain situations. An adult who cares about you will help you decide what’s best for you in this situation. A group is ganging up on someone if they: Tease, keep secrets, or make a person work to stay in the group. If you ever get ganged up on, talk to an adult who can help you decide if you should: work things out with the group, leave the group, or choose to be friends with some people in the group. Let’s see what Niko does when he realizes he’s being ganged up on. Niko: Hey, guys. Ready for class? Andy: Yeah, if you have the Math homework done for us. Niko: I’ve given you my Math every day. You’re not going to know the material. Andy: Oh no, we won’t know the material! Shay: We need the Science questions too. Niko: I have the Math done, but the Science isn't done yet. Andy: Just do it while we’re copying off your Math. Come on, we’re still friends, right? Niko: I don’t think I want to give you my homework anymore. Mrs. Brunell, can I talk to you about something? Teacher: Sure. What’s up? Niko: Well, Shay and Andy keep copying my homework. Teacher: Why are you giving it to them? Niko: Well, they made me. I stopped now but I thought they were my friends. Teacher: Okay, thanks for telling me. They aren’t being your friend. I'll talk to them. Andy: I guess we were kind of mean to Niko. We shouldn’t have made him do our homework for us. Niko: I’m glad I stopped giving them my homework and talked to Mrs. Brunell. Now I know they were ganging up on me. Teacher: I’m glad Niko told me about the situation. I need to talk to Shay and Andy. No one should be ganging up on anyone. Niko: Andy and Shay are always asking me to do things for them. That’s not how friends act. I’m glad I told them I won’t give them my homework anymore. It made me feel better to talk to my teacher too. Niko knew what to look for in a real group of friends. He figured out this group was ganging up on him and made a plan to ask his teacher to help him decide how to handle it. So, what did we learn? A group is ganging up on someone if they: tease, keep secrets, or make a person work to stay in the group. If you ever get ganged up on, talk to an adult who can help you decide if you should: work things out with the group, leave the group, or choose to be friends with some people.

Ugh, now it looks even worse! I don’t want to do this anymore! When Haley had a tough time, she wanted to give up. Did this solution solve her problem? Haley felt frustrated that her drawing did not come out the way she wanted. This is a small problem that made her feel very upset. She told herself she is bad at coloring.

It takes practice to get good at something. I bet I can fix it. That looks better. Connor: Yeah, not bad! Haley: Thanks. Haley was able to change her thinking, from telling herself she can’t do it to telling herself she can. This is called using positive thinking. You tell yourself you can do it and find strategies that will help you. Haley knew that not liking her drawing was a small problem, so she stayed calm and used positive thinking to keep trying even when it was hard. If Haley gave up, she would feel bad about herself and get a poor grade. That would make the problem worse. But by staying positive and trying to think of a strategy to get better instead of giving up, Haley was able to complete her project. So, what did we learn?

To figure out how someone is feeling, we use all the clues they give us. We focus on: Their facial expression – how do they look? Can we tell how they feel? Their tone of voice - how their voice sounds And the words they say - what message do their words send? After we hear from each person, we’ll stop and discuss all of the clues that help us figure out what emotion they are feeling. Let’s get started! Round 1 Watch Jack and decide how he’s feeling. Jack: My teacher keeps telling me to do my work, but I don’t want to do my work! I want to play on the computer! Why won’t she let me do what I want to do? I don’t want to do any work! How does Jack feel? Let’s look at the clues: Let’s start by looking at his facial expression. His eyes are squinting, his eyebrows are scrunched together, and his head is looking down. How do you think his facial expression looks? Now, let’s listen and focus on his tone of voice. Is his voice high or low, loud or soft? Jack: My teacher keeps telling me to do my work, but I don’t want to do my work! I want to play on the computer! Why won’t she let me do what I want to do? I don’t want to do any work!

Choose one of these emotions: Uncomfortable Angry Proud Worried Jack was feeling... angry. It’s hard to control ourselves when we feel angry. Being angry can feel like our stomach is upset, our bodies are hot or sweaty, and we have trouble focusing on anything else. When is a time you felt angry? Do you remember what it felt like? How did you make yourself feel better? Watch Kiara and decide how she’s feeling. Kiara: My neighbor invited me to a barbeque this weekend. I can’t wait to go! How does Kiara feel? Let’s look at the clues: Let’s start by looking at her facial expression. Her eyebrows are raised, and she has a big smile on her face. How do you think her facial expression looks? Now, let’s listen and focus on her tone of voice. Is her voice rising or falling? Do you hear any emotions in it? Kiara: My neighbor invited me to a barbeque this weekend. I can’t wait to go! How do you think she sounds? Lastly, let's listen to the words she uses. Kiara: My neighbor invited me to a barbeque this weekend. I can’t wait to go! Kiara says she can’t wait to go to the barbeque. How do you think Kiara was feeling? Choose one of these emotions: Nervous Bored Happy Surprised Kiara was feeling... happy! We can tell from the way her face looked, the way her voice sounded, and the words she told us that she was happy about being invited to the barbeque. How does your body feel and look when you’re happy? Watch Connor and decide how he’s feeling. Connor: My best friend is going to a new school next year, so I won’t be able to see him. I’m really going to miss him. Now who am I going to hang out with? How does Connor feel? Let’s look at the clues: Let’s start by looking at his facial expression. His eyebrows are lowered, his eyes are looking down, and his mouth is turned down. How do you think his facial expression looks? Now, let’s listen and focus on his tone of voice. Does his voice sound high or low, loud or soft? Connor: My best friend is going to a new school next year, so I won’t be able to see him. I’m really going to miss him. Now who am I going to hang out with? How do you think he sounds? Lastly, let's listen to the words he uses. Connor: My best friend is going to a new school next year, so I won’t be able to see him. I’m really going to miss him. Now who am I going to hang out with? Connor tells us that his best friend is moving and he’s going to miss him. How do you think Connor was feeling? Choose one of these emotions: Confused Calm Surprised Sad Connor was feeling... sad. We can tell Connor looked sad because of his facial expression. His eyes were looking down and his mouth was turned down. His tone of voice also sounded very sad because his voice was low and soft. His words told us that he was sad about not being able to see his friend again. What does it feel like when you feel sad? When is a time you felt sad? Watch Hailey and decide how she’s feeling. Hailey: Whoa! I didn’t think we would win the science fair. I thought that we were good, but I didn’t think we were that good! I can’t believe it! How does Hailey feel? Let’s look at the clues: Let’s start by looking at her facial expression. Her eyebrows are raised up, her eyes are wide open, and her mouth is in an open circle. How do you think her facial expression looks? Now, let’s listen and focus on her tone of voice. Does her voice sound high or low, loud or soft? Hailey: Whoa!

Lastly, let's listen to the words she uses. Hailey: Whoa! I didn’t think we would win the science fair. I thought that we were good, but I didn’t think we were that good! I can’t believe it! Hailey said she couldn’t believe they won the science fair. What are the clues there? How do you think Hailey was feeling? Choose one of these emotions: Upset Surprised Uncomfortable Happy Hailey was feeling... surprised! We can tell Hailey was feeling surprised by her facial expression. She had raised eyebrows, wide eyes, and an open mouth. Her tone of voice sounded surprised because her voice was a little louder than usual and was rising. Her words told us she didn’t think she was going to win the science fair, so we know she was surprised. Have you ever seen somebody look surprised? When? We saw a lot of different emotions today. Remember, to figure out how someone is feeling, we use all of the clues they give us. We focus on: Their facial expression - how do they look? Can we tell how they feel? Their tone of voice - how their voice sounds And the words they say - what message do their words send? When we put all these clues together, we can tell how someone is feeling. See you next time!

First, we notice our thoughts and how our bodies feel as it’s happening You may feel like yelling or be tempted to say something mean. Ask yourself, “How can I change my thinking?” Then, use a strategy that works for that emotion. Do I need to take deep breaths, take a break, or think of the good side? We make ourselves feel better by changing the channel on big or negative thoughts. It’s important to know how to control those big emotions. If they control us, we can accidentally make bad decisions or hurt others. If we’re feeling really sad, we can think of something to cheer us up to Change the Channel on our sad thoughts. If we’re feeling angry, we can pick a strategy to calm down to change the channel on our anger. Sometimes, we just need some time so we don’t act on our big emotions. We can think, “I’ll take some time until I feel better” before doing anything we might regret later. When these big feelings like frustration, anger, or sadness try to take over, we change the channel to make sure they don’t. We can learn to control our emotions and keep them from controlling us.

This can make other people feel annoyed. There are times when you can say when we are good at something. But the way we say it and how often we say it matters. It's important to think about time and place. If others are talking about how difficult something is, it usually isn't a good time to talk about how good you are at it. To make sure we're not bragging, we can: Think about the time or when we're talking about how good we are at something. Is it a time when someone else is having a hard time? Think about how often we say it. We shouldn't repeat it multiple times on multiple days. Think about how our voice sounds. Are we using a condescending tone of voice?

It wasn't the right time to talk about how good he was at Math because Zach was having a hard time. Justin should also think about the way his voice sounds and the words he used. Justin: Math is so easy for me. I'm thinking about moving up a level. His tone of voice sounded like he didn't care about Zach's feelings. He was only thinking about himself. Let's watch Justin try again. Zach: Ugh! These formulas are so hard! Justin: This is really easy for me but... Zach is having a hard time, so it wouldn't make him feel good to hear that. Maybe I shouldn't tell him how easy it is for me. I can try to help him out. There's a formula chart at the end of the chapter that's really helpful. Zach: Okay, yeah, I'll take a look. Justin: It also helps if you carry the numbers throughout the entire problem. Zach: Do you think you can help me with the first one? Justin: Sure. No problem. Justin was able to think about the time and place before he bragged about himself. He knew that it wasn't the best time to talk about how easy Math is for him. Instead, he offered some help and still showed that Math is something he is good at. This made Justin feel proud without bragging about himself, and he was able to help a friend.

SEL,Being Mindful,SEL03,https://slp.everydayspeech.com/video/being-mindful,2-3,2-3,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,Aug-20,,TEACHER SCRIPT: Today we’re going to practice being mindful by completing a Body Scan together. Who can define mindfulness?,Meditation Videos,,,,,,https://res.cloudinary.com/everyday-speech/raw/upload/v1619186994/SubtitlesVTT/SEL03_Being_Mindful.vtt," Mindfulness means paying attention to the present moment, and focusing on what’s happening right now. It’s easy to get stressed out about something that just happened to us or something that we have to do tomorrow. It’s been proven that when we stop and focus on the now, we can relieve some of the stress and anxiety we feel in our everyday lives. Being Mindful can help us because it: Reduces feelings of stress and anxiety. Increases feelings of happiness and energy. Creates more focused thinking. Improves physical well-being. Here are 5 ways you can practice being mindful everyday: One, Focus during your morning routine. We all get up and get ready so try to be extra mindful and pay attention as you brush your teeth or pack your backpack. Rather than letting our brains go on autopilot, stop and think about each action you’re doing. Two, Accept the present. Focus all of your energy on what’s happening right now. Scan your body from head to toe and pay attention to how you feel. Scan the environment to notice any sounds, smells, or sensations that are happening right now. Doesn’t it feel good not to worry about something that happened in the past or is about to happen? Three, Stop the judgement. Let go of any thoughts or feelings about how good you are at this and just think about the couple of minutes you’re putting in to being mindful. It doesn’t matter if your thoughts come quickly or slowly, or your attention wanders in and out. Just feel good that you put time into being mindful today. Four, Pick a mantra. Repeat a phrase to yourself like I will accept what comes or I am enough. A good mantra is anything that makes you feel positive. Five, Get reflective. Think about your day and what you can bring with you into the present and future. Let anything go that doesn’t bring you joy or serve you. Do you think you can pick one or more of those five ideas and incorporate them into your daily life? Starting small makes it much easier to keep up and actually try. Talk about or write down the one way to be mindful that seemed the best one for you to start with. Teachers, you can pause here to discuss mindful habits with your students. Then, I’ll guide you through a 2-minute mindful body scan. Now, we’re going to do a 2-minute body scan. Get comfortable in your chair and close your eyes. Notice how your body feels right now. Feel the weight of your body in your chair. Breathe in deeply. Breathe out. Start at the top of your head. Bring all of your awareness there. Don’t worry if your thoughts float in and out. Just let them. Scan how the top of your head feels. Notice any sensations or feelings without judgement. We’re just taking stock of how we feel right now in this moment. Now, bring all of your awareness on your ears. Move to the tip of your nose. Corners of your mouth. Soften your jaw. Think about your neck and the middle of your throat. Let them be soft. Scan down to your shoulders. Try to relax them down. We hold a lot of tension in our shoulders, so try to be mindful of relaxing them throughout your day. Move down to your stomach. Does it feel tight or soft? Can you soften it even more? Take a deep breath in. Travel down to your hands. How do they feel? Are they tensed up? Can you relax them? Notice the weight of your legs in the chair. Do they feel heavy? Do they feel light? Scan all the way down to your toes. Feel your feet on the floor. Take one more breath in. Feel the weight of your whole body. Be thankful for this moment. Great job. If you have time, talk about how that felt. What was the hardest part? How does your body feel afterwards? How does your mind feel? If we take the time to do a quick body scan exercise like that every day, it goes a long way to keeping our minds happy and calm. "," Mindfulness means paying attention to the present moment, and focusing on what’s happening right now. It’s easy to get stressed out about something that just happened to us or something that we have to do tomorrow. It’s been proven that when we stop and focus on the now, we can relieve some of the stress and anxiety we feel in our everyday lives. Being Mindful can help us because it: Reduces feelings of stress and anxiety. Increases feelings of happiness and energy. Creates more focused thinking. Improves physical well-being. Here are 5 ways you can practice being mindful everyday: One, Focus during your morning routine. We all get up and get ready so try to be extra mindful and pay attention as you brush your teeth or pack your backpack. Rather than letting our brains go on autopilot, stop and think about each action you’re doing. Two, Accept the present. Focus all of your energy on what’s happening right now. Scan your body from head to toe and pay attention to how you feel. Scan the environment to notice any sounds, smells, or sensations that are happening right now. Doesn’t it feel good not to worry about something that happened in the past or is about to happen? Three, Stop the judgement. Let go of any thoughts or feelings about how good you are at this and just think about the couple of minutes you’re putting in to being mindful. It doesn’t matter if your thoughts come quickly or slowly, or your attention wanders in and out. Just feel good that you put time into being ",0.4777481867

In this video, we're going to try to figure out how people are going to react to different situations. After each video, we'll give you three choices. You have to guess which one is going to happen. This video is all about school behavior. We're going to watch the character's actions in school and think about how they made the rest of the class feel. Did they have a positive outcome or did they make others feel uncomfortable or upset? Whenever we see this icon in the corner, we can stop and talk about the situation. Let's get ready to watch. The class just got back from vacation. Let's see how Jack is feeling. Teacher: Alright. Hope everyone had a nice break. Let's pick up where we left off in chapter 9 of our textbooks. Jack, pick your head up please. Jack: I don't want to! Teacher: You need to follow along with the rest of the class. Jack: I don't want to! What do you think Jack's teacher is going to do next? Let Jack keep his head down. Tell Jack he's in trouble. Ignore Jack. Teacher: Jack, you lost your computer time for the rest of the day. Sometimes when we come back from vacation, we have a hard time adjusting to our new schedule. At home, we might not have to wake up as early. When we get back to school, we still have to do our school work, even if we don't want to. It might be hard at first, but we still need to follow the rules in class and try to use the best actions to make others think positively about us. Is there anything that is hard for you when you come back to school after a vacation? Haley is working on a project for Social Studies. Let's watch what happens. Teacher: Haley, do you need help with something? Haley: No, I can do it myself. Teacher: Why don't you let me help? There's only a little bit of time left in class. Haley: No! I can do it myself! What do you think will happen with Haley's art project? She'll finish it and get a good grade. She'll be happy with how it comes out. She won't finish it in time. Teacher: That's all the time we have. I'll collect your projects now. Haley: I'm not done yet! When we're doing work, we might want to do it all by ourself. But we have to remember that our teachers are there to help us. By not accepting help, Haley wasn't able to finish her project. If we accept the help, it can be much easier to solve our problem. Can you remember a time when you didn't want anyone else to help you? What ended up happening? Let's watch Jack try to figure out if this is the right time to talk to his teacher. Teacher: Madison, what seems to be the trouble? Madison: I'm not sure what they're asking on number four. Teacher: Oh, okay. Let's take a look at it. Jack: I need help with number four too. Let me look. Is this a good time to ask for help? Ms. Lehane is helping Madison now. I could listen and see if what she says will help me with number four too. Teacher: Let's read the question and see what they're asking for. Madison: Oh, they want to know what materials are used. Teacher: Mm-hmm. Jack: I think now is a good time to ask a question. Ms. Lehane is done with Madison. What do you think will happen now that Jack has waited for his teacher to be done helping another student to ask his question? His teacher will ignore him. He might get in trouble for asking too many questions. His teacher will be able to answer his question. Teacher: Yes, Jack? Jack: Is this a two-part question? Teacher: It is. They want to know the material used and why. Jack: Oh. We need to find the best time to talk to our teacher. If they are busy helping other students, we should wait, like Jack did, until they are done. Then they will be able to help you. What are some tools you can use, that you already have, to be sure that your teacher isn't busy before you ask for some help? Let's see what happens when Madison gets a little upset when doing her school work. Madison: These are so hard. I don't like this at all. I can't do it anymore! This is really frustrating! What do I do again? Alright. I'm getting upset. I need to take a break. Let me take some deep breaths. That usually helps me. How will Madison be feeling now? Madison will feel... Very upset at the problems. Calmer than she was before. Bored by the problems. Madison: Alright. I feel better. Let's see here. Okay. I know 49 and 28 are divisible by 7. Maybe that's the greatest common factor. Madison did a great job recognizing how she was feeling. She knew she was getting frustrated and upset, so she took time to calm down. That helped her clear her mind and finish her work. If she didn't take a break, she might have gotten overwhelmed and not be able to finish. What's the best strategy for you when you need to calm down? Great job, everyone! We learned a lot about how our behaviors can impact other people. Some examples of behaviors that had a positive impact were: Waiting until your teacher is done helping others before you ask for help and using strategies to calm down. Well, some behaviors that didn't make people feel so good were: Not following the classroom rules and not accepting help from an adult. Try to think about your actions in school and how they can make others feel. Will the outcome be positive or give people negative thoughts? See you next time!

To help us figure out whether something was done on purpose or not, we can use the On Purpose Plan. If someone plans to hurt another person’s feelings, that is on purpose. If someone hasn’t planned it and it just happened, it was an accident. To use the On Purpose Plan, we can: Look at the other person’s reactions. We can tell if someone has planned something by looking at how they react. Think about their facial expression, tone of voice, and actions. Do they look surprised or angry that this happened? Let’s see how Eric uses the On Purpose Plan. Eric: I can't get my binder open. Kiara: Here, let me help you. Eric: Thanks. Kiara: Oh no! The paper ripped a little. Eric: Oh no, my paper ripped! But... this is a small problem. I don’t need to get upset. I can tell Kiara didn’t mean to rip it on purpose. Eric: It’s okay. Kiara: I’m so sorry, Eric. Let me get you some tape. Eric: Okay, thanks. Eric: I felt upset that my paper ripped, but I used the On Purpose Plan. I noticed how Kiara reacted. She looked surprised and upset when the paper ripped. This helped me realize that Kiara didn’t rip the paper on purpose. It was an accident, so I shouldn’t be upset with her. When something happens and upsets us, we can use the On Purpose Plan to figure out if the action was on purpose or not. Eric watched Kiara’s reaction to the paper ripping. She looked surprised that the paper ripped. Kiara also said “Oh no!” when it happened, which means she didn’t mean to rip the paper. Even though Eric was upset, he used the On Purpose Plan to figure out that the paper ripping was an accident. Eric stayed calm and did not get upset with Kiara. So, what did we learn? If someone plans to hurt another person’s feelings, that is on purpose. If someone hasn’t planned it and it just happened, it was an accident. To use the On Purpose Plan, we can: Look at the other person’s reactions We can tell if someone has planned something by looking at how they react. Think about their facial expressions, tone of voice, and actions. Do they look surprised or angry that this happened?

Kiara: Here, let me help you. Eric: Thanks. Kiara: Oh no! The paper ripped a little. Eric: Oh no, my paper ripped! But... this is a small problem. I don’t need to get upset. I can tell Kiara didn’t mean to rip it on purpose. Eric: It’s okay. Kiara: I’m so sorry, Eric. Let me get you some tape. Eric: Okay, thanks. Eric: I felt upset that my paper ripped, but I used the On Purpose Plan. I noticed how Kiara reacted. She looked surprised and upset when the paper ripped. This helped me realize that Kiara didn’t rip the paper on purpose. It was an accident, so I shouldn’t be upset with her. When something happens and upsets us, we can use the On Purpose Plan to figure out if the action was on purpose or not. Eric watched Kiara’s reaction to the paper ripping.

If we are nervous to say how we feel, we can use positive self-talk. This means telling ourself a positive phrase in our head. Let’s see what happens when Mike doesn’t tell Alessandra how he’s feeling. Mike: Hey, Alessandra! Alessandra: Hey, Mikey! Mike: I really don’t like that nickname. People used to call me Mikey when I was little. I’d rather be called Mike now but I’ll just ignore it. Mike: I was just wondering if you're still going to that student council meeting after school.

Greetings like ""What's up?"" tell you to keep your talking turn short, whereas specific questions mean we're expected to speak for a longer time.

In this video, we’re going to decide if people used the Conversation Measuring Cup or not. The Conversation Measuring Cup helps us figure out how much to talk during a conversation, so we don’t say too much or too little. When someone greets you with a general question like, “What’s up?” it’s usually a clue to keep your turn short and respond with something like, “Not much. How about you?” This barely fills our Conversation Measuring Cup, but it is just right for the situation. When people ask you a specific or more detailed question like, “What did you do this weekend?” that’s a clue they’re interested in talking for a longer time. This fills the Conversation Measuring Cup to the top, and we can talk more. If we don’t use our Conversation Measuring Cup, we could give long answers at a time when it would be better for a short one. This can be confusing or annoying because it doesn’t match the situation. We always take turns during a conversation, no matter what. Use your Conversation Measuring Cup to figure out how much to talk. When you hear a greeting, fill your cup a little and keep your talking turn short. When you’re asked a specific question, you can fill up your cup and talk longer on your turn. Watch body language and listen to other's tone of voice for clues to see if they want to keep talking more. Now, we’re going to watch four scenes and decide if each person was using the Conversation Measuring Cup. Every time we see this icon in the corner, stop and discuss what happened in the scene. Decide if the characters used the Conversation Measuring Cup successfully. Did they talk too little, too much, or just enough? Let’s get started! Niko: Hey, Andy, what’s up? Andy: Not much. I got Science lab next. Niko: Cool, have fun. See you at lunch! Andy: See you later! Did Andy use the Conversation Measuring Cup? Andy did use the Conversation Measuring Cup. He knew to keep the conversation short when Niko said, “What’s up?” It wasn’t a good time for a long conversation, so he kept it short. Can you name two other times when it’s obvious there’s only time for a short conversation? Let’s see another one. Natalie: I can’t wait for the pizza party this Friday! Andy: I know! I heard we might even get popsicles for dessert. Natalie: No way! I’m so excited. You’re coming, right, Niko? Are you excited? Niko: Yep. Andy: So, what are you guys favorite kind of pizza? Natalie: That’s tough. I think I like plain cheese the best. Andy: Mine's pepperoni! I get it every time I have pizza. Natalie: So, what's your favorite kind of pizza? Niko: Cheese. Andy: Have you ever had Hawaiian pizza? Niko: No. Did Niko use the Conversation Measuring Cup? Niko did not use the Conversation Measuring Cup. Natalie and Andy were including Niko in their conversation about the pizza party. Even though Niko answered their questions, he barely filled his Conversation Measuring Cup. When others ask you specific questions, it’s the right time to add to the conversation with connected comments or questions. Did you notice how they waited for him to jump in? In this situation, Niko should have filled his Conversation Measuring Cup and talked more. Have you ever been part of a conversation where someone wasn’t answering your questions? How did it feel? Let’s watch another situation. Natalie: Hey Andy, what’s up? Andy: Not much. Natalie: You’ll never guess what just happened. Andy: What? Natalie: I just found out we’re getting a new playground! I wonder if we'll get some more swings or maybe we'll have a really tall slide. Andy: That’s cool. I didn’t know that. Natalie: I can’t wait to tell everyone! I hope they can get it before summer. This is going to be so awesome. Monkey bars make me feel like I’m in gymnastics class. This is gonna be so cool! Did Natalie use the Conversation Measuring Cup? No, Natalie did not use the Conversation Measuring Cup. She talked too much and her conversation turns did not fit the situation. Her Conversation Measuring Cup overflowed. When Andy answered, ""Not much,"" he was responding to be polite. He went right back to reading, which showed he wasn’t wanting a longer talk. What’s another clue that Natalie could have noticed to figure out how much to fill the Conversion Measuring Cup? Let’s watch one more. Natalie: Hey! Madison: Hey! Madison: I haven’t seen you in forever! Natalie: What's going on? Madison: Well, did you hear? My brother broke his leg. Natalie: Oh no! How? Madison: Well, he was at a skatepark. He’s on crutches now, but he was in a wheelchair for three weeks. Natalie: Oh my gosh, that’s horrible! Did Madison use the Conversation Measuring Cup? She did! Madison knew to keep the conversation going and fill up the Conversation Measuring Cup. Even though Natalie used a general greeting, her body language and excited tone of voice told Madison that she wanted to talk more. Name two more clues that would tell you that someone wants to talk with you longer. We can use the Conversation Measuring Cup any time we talk to others. We start by noticing what kind of greeting or conversation starter they’re using. This gives us clues if it’s the right time to talk a little or a lot. Watch the clues they give you in their body language and tone of voice. We use the Conversation Measuring Cup to figure out how much to talk. When you hear a greeting, fill your cup a little and keep your talking turn short. When you’re asked a specific question, you can fill up your cup and talk longer on your turn.

We show respect with our actions when we treat others with kindness, fairness, and politeness. Respectful beliefs are ways to keep our minds open. We shouldn’t judge people who are different from us or assume that people of one culture or race are all the same. We must remember that everyone is unique and special in their own way. The more aware we are of what these words and actions look like, the more likely we are to incorporate them into our daily lives. Some ways to help us practice showing respect include: Give sincere compliments to others. Complimenting others on their unique strengths and characteristics makes them feel valued. Have an open mind. When we approach others with an open mind and are willing to listen, it shows them that we respect their thoughts and opinions, even if we do not necessarily agree with them right away. Plus, who knows? Maybe they will teach us something new and help us to grow and be a better person. Acts of service for others Try helping out more at home with chores, helping a friend in need, or donating your time in your community through charity. These are all examples of how we can show respect through our actions. Learn about others The more we talk to people who are different from us, the more opportunities we have to learn and grow. This helps us value and show respect to all people, not just the ones we’re familiar with. Pause here to discuss examples of these strategies. Everyone should write down or discuss one personal goal they can set to be more respectful. Disrespect Part of learning and acknowledging respect is also understanding what disrespect looks like. Disrespectful behaviors include interrupting others, talking behind others’ backs, ignoring boundaries, and laughing at others in inappropriate situations. These behaviors are hurtful and often make people feel devalued or less than. Strategies Against Disrespect Battling disrespect starts one habit at a time. Stand up for others who are being disrespected. Most disrespect happens in words that make someone feel less worthy than others. Speak up when someone is talking about someone in a disrespectful way. You can be the reason people change their disrespectful habits. Tell that person how their words and actions make you feel. You don’t have to be the same gender, race, age, or culture to feel offended. You are absolutely right in feeling offended by anyone’s disrespect of someone else. Continue to show others what respect looks like by being respectful yourself. Don’t forget the Golden Rule: Treat others how you want to be treated. Now is a good time to pause to talk and discuss some real-life situations and the actual words someone might use in those situations. Friends Show Respect If you are being shown disrespect by someone you consider a friend, step back and think about the situation. Is this how a friend should make you feel? Remember, it is okay to end friendships with people who disrespect others or make you feel uncomfortable. Self-Respect Do not forget to have respect for yourself! Self-respect is an important part of being able to show others respect. Remember, you are valuable, and your thoughts and opinions matter. Remember, none of us are well until all of us are well. By showing respect in our community, we contribute to the building of an equal world where everyone is respected. DISCUSSION: Define respect Do you believe respect is earned or should be shown to everyone, no matter what? Name three ways you can show your teacher respect. Name three ways you can show someone who is different than you respect. "," Respect is treating others in a way that makes them feel valued. Everyone deserves respect. We celebrate and respect others for who they are regardless of differences in abilities, interests, age, race, gender, or culture. That means accepting someone for who they are and who they identify as, even if they are different from us or we do not agree with them. Self-Reflect Think about yourself and your actions lately. Do you believe that everyone is equal and deserves respect? Do you show others who are different than you respect? Showing Respect We show respect through our words, actions, and beliefs.

This can help us feel more in control and ready to learn. Let’s see what happens when Connor has too much energy. Jack: My brother just got a brand new Nintendo 3DS. It’s so cool! Connor: I’m having a hard time listening to Jack because I have so much energy. My body feels wiggly like I can’t sit still. I can squeeze my hands together. That makes me feel better. Connor: I want to try one of those. Jack: Yeah! I hope he lets me use it. Connor was able to realize that his body had so much energy it was making it hard to listen. He needed to calm down. Connor used squeezing his hands to get some of his energy out. Last, let’s see what happens when we're about to lose control because of our feelings. Connor: I can’t figure out this word and I’m so frustrated. Now I can’t focus on the book. This doesn’t feel good. I can take deep breaths to calm down. Okay, that feels better. Maybe I can ask for help. Miss Lehane, can you help me with this word? Teacher: Sure. Which one are you looking at? That time, Connor was able to use deep breaths to get his body back in control. He breathed in slowly and then out slowly four times. This helped him calm down, feel more in control, and take a step to solve his problem. Remember, next time you feel out of control, think about how your body feels and what could help. If you are hungry, get a snack. If you are tired, get some water or stretch. If you’re body is moving fast, squeeze something or take a break or a walk. If you're feeling really angry, sad, or excited, take long deep breaths. "," - When we feel like we are losing self-control, we need to notice how we feel so we can take steps to get back in control. It’s important to think about how you feel and notice what your body is telling you. Do you feel hungry or thirsty? Do you feel hot or cold? Are you moving slowly or really fast? Once you realize how you feel, you can take steps to get back in control. Let’s see what this looks like. Connor: I didn’t eat much for breakfast today. It's hard to do my work because I keep thinking about getting food. Connor: Miss Lehane, can I have my snack? Teacher: Sure. Connor was having a hard time concentrating on his work when his body needed food. He made sure to ask his teacher if he could have a snack. Let’s see another example of keeping yourself in control when you don’t have any energy. Jack: I feel tired and my body is moving slow. I think I should get a drink of water.

At each step, we’ll talk about the problem, and how we can solve it. The steps we’ll go through are: Identify the problem - what’s wrong? Figure out how big the problem is.

Christine: I need to use the computer for my report, but Liz is using it. I was waiting for it! Christine’s problem is that she was waiting for the computer, and Liz took it. How big is the problem? Where would you put this on the scale? Christine: I can handle this myself. And it shouldn't take too long to solve. It's a pretty small problem. This is a small problem.

I could explain that I've been waiting. Or I could wait for her to finish. You might have come up with different solutions, and that’s okay. The next step is to pick a solution. Should Christine Yell At Liz, Explain She’s been Waiting, or Wait for Liz to Finish? Let’s watch Christine pick a solution. Christine: I really want to use it now, so I'm going to yell at Liz. Christine was so angry. She decided to yell at Liz to get what she wanted. The final step is to try the solution and reassess. Let’s see Christine try her solution. Christine: Hey! I wanted to use the computer! That's not fair! Liz: Well, I'm using it now! Christine: Let me use it! Teacher: If we can't use the computers quietly, we won't use them at all. Christine: Ugh. Let’s reassess. Do you think Christine picked the best solution? Christine: That did not solve my problem. I still have to wait for the computer. If I could do it again, I would ask Liz nicely and explain that I was waiting. That way, Liz would probably let me use the computer and our teacher would not come over. That would be a better solution to my problem. Christine didn’t solve her problem by yelling at Liz. It made Liz angry and the teacher come over. Next time, Christine can calmly explain the situation to Liz. That might be a better solution to her problem. Problem solving is a process. We try solutions and think about how they worked.

When we share the conversation, people feel happy. Being good at the Conversation Share means we: All get the same time to talk. We take turns talking and listening. We keep our comments the same length so we’re not doing too much of the talking. That way, everyone is happy. Let’s see what sharing the conversation looks like. Brandon: My soccer game on Saturday, it rained the whole time. Simon: Mine too! I was the goalie and I was sliding all over the place. Brandon: I was on defense. My whole area was this one huge mud pit. I just kept skating and falling. I fell three times. Simon: On the way home, I had to sit on a grocery bag and my mom said, “Don’t touch anything!” Brandon: I got my mom’s car all dirty from my cleats.

SEL,Reacting to Problems,SEL28,https://slp.everydayspeech.com/video/reacting-to-problems,2,2-3,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,Aug-20,,TEACHER SCRIPT: Today we’re discussing what strategies to use when reacting to a problem. Reflect on a time where you might have overreacted to a problem. How did you feel afterward?,Solving a Problem,,,,,,https://res.cloudinary.com/everyday-speech/raw/upload/v1619186997/SubtitlesVTT/SEL28_Reacting_to_Problems.vtt," We all face problems in our day to day lives at home and at school. Some of our problems are from mistakes we made, like oversleeping and missing the bus. Other problems are out of our control and are bad luck, like our game getting rained out. While we may not be able to avoid facing these kinds of problems, we can control how we react to them. Part of being a successful problem-solver is controlling our feelings in the moment. When our reaction matches the size of our problems, we are better problem-solvers. Becoming more aware of how we are feeling when faced with a problem and how to handle those feelings can be tricky. Often times, we feel overwhelmed or anxious when faced with a big problem. These are normal feelings, but how can we process and handle these emotions in the moment? We can try to: Stop and think Problems often come up unexpectedly and catch us ‘off guard’. Taking a few seconds or minutes to process our problems before reacting is important. It helps us stay calm. Think about the time and place Before we react to our problem, consider where we are, who we are with, and what’s going on in that moment. Are we in public or among friends and family? Sometimes, we may need to take a second to step away from others to help us stay in control of feelings. Teachers, now is a good time to pause and talk through these strategies. What good things can happen from stopping and thinking? When we look around, we remember to think about others. Are others’ feelings just as important as ours? If we try to solve a problem without taking the time to stop and think, we may overreact to the situation. This often happens because we have forgotten to slow down and take the necessary problem-solving steps to solve our problem. This type of thinking causes us to overreact or see the problem as bigger than it is. Think about how it looks to others if you have a big reaction to a small problem, like someone crying in class if they got a bad grade. Pause now to talk about a time or a situation where you overreacted? How could you have prevented or better handled that situation? It is also important to realize that people may have different reactions to the same problem. For example, if the music assembly that you were going to perform in was canceled, you would probably feel upset. versus one of your classmates who was not supposed to perform in the assembly would probably not feel upset by this. Both of these are valid reactions for these individuals, even though they are different. Self-control can be a hard skill to master. Being able to identify and control our feelings and reactions to a big problem takes practice. Next time you are feeling overwhelmed by a problem, remember to use a strategy to keep control, like taking deep breaths or counting to 10. What is a strategy that helps you keep calm and stay in control? Try not to put off a problem for too long. If we ignore a problem, we could end up making it worse or more difficult to solve. If a problem seems too overwhelming or too difficult to solve on your own, ask an adult for help. DISCUSSION: How might we make others feel if we publicly overreact to a problem? How does “Stop and Think” help us keep calm in an overwhelming or stressful situation? Why might two different people have different reactions to the same problem?

Small talk is a short conversation that stays on general topics everyone can talk about. We might use this when we pass one person in an empty hallway, someone walks in the room, or we sit down next to someone. If we don’t make small talk when we’re with other people, they might feel upset or offended. Our silence sends a message that we are not interested. A good way to start small talk is using The Two W’s. The Two W’s include the Weather and the Weekend. It’s easy to talk about the weather. You look outside and make a comment about what you see. You might say, “Nice day, today” or “Looks like it’s about to rain.” The weekend is easy to talk about too because there is either just been one or there’s one coming up. We might say, “What are you up to this weekend?” or “I did _____ this weekend.” Small talk might end quickly, or it can also lead to a more interesting conversation that forms a bond with others. To make small talk with friends, use the Two W’s: the Weather and the Weekend. Some phrases we can use are: What a beautiful day! Some weather we’re having! I’m looking forward to next weekend. What did you do last weekend? Let’s see what happens if we don’t make small talk with others. Kai: Hey, Shay! Shay: Hey. What’s up? Kai: Nothing much, you? Shay: Not much. Shay: So... What happened there? Neither boy made small talk. How do they feel? Let’s see what they’re thinking. Kai: I wanted to talk to Shay, but I didn’t know what to talk about. He’s not talking to me either. Shay: I like Kai, but I’m not sure he likes me. He doesn’t seem to want to talk to me. Kai and Shay didn’t use small talk. This accidentally sent an unfriendly message and left both boys feeling awkward. What could they have talked about instead? Let’s watch what happens when Kai uses the Two W’s to make small talk with Shay. Kai: Hey, Shay! Shay: Hey, what’s up? Kai: Nothing much, you? Shay: Not much. Kai: How can I make small talk with Shay? I can use the Two W’s: Weather and Weekend. What did you do this weekend? Shay: I went to a museum with my cousin. Kai: Cool! What kind of museum? Shay: The Museum of Science. What did you do? Kai: Oh, I went to a birthday party. Shay: How was it? Kai: It was at a bowling alley. It was really fun. Shay: Cool, I love bowling. Kai: Yeah, it was awesome. Let’s see what Kai and Shay are thinking about each other now. Shay: Kai wanted to talk to me. Maybe he’s going to start becoming a better friend of mine. I’m going to start being friendlier with him, too. Kai: That small talk only took about like 10 seconds, but it made us feel like better friends. That time, Kai made some small talk with Shay. He showed interest and friendliness so that both he and Shay would feel good. They had a short conversation about the weekend. Small talk only takes a few seconds, but it’s important because it shows people you’re interested in them. The next time you aren’t sure what to say, use the Two W’s: the Weather and the Weekend. Some phrases we can use are: What a beautiful day! Some weather we’re having. I’m looking forward to next weekend. What did you do last weekend? "," Whenever we’re with other people, we make small talk to make the moment more comfortable and friendly. Small talk is a short conversation that stays on general topics everyone can talk about. We might use this when we pass one person in an empty hallway, someone walks in the room, or we sit down next to someone. If we don’t make small talk when we’re with other people, they might feel upset or offended. Our silence sends a message that we are not interested. A good way to start small talk is using The Two W’s. The Two W’s include the Weather and the Weekend. It’s easy to talk about the weather. You look outside and make a comment about what you see. You might say, “Nice day, today” or “Looks like it’s about to rain.” The weekend is easy to talk about too because there is either just been one or there’s one coming up. We might say, “What are you up to this weekend?” or “I did _____ this weekend.” Small talk might end quickly, or it can also lead to a more interesting conversation that forms a bond with others.

Think about if this is something you need to say or if you should keep it in your head. Let's see what this looks like when Leah is too honest. Rachel: I saw you at the chorus concert! Leah: Yeah, my brother is in the 7th Grade chorus so my family went. Rachel: Did you see my solo? I was so nervous. Do you think it went okay? Leah: It seemed like you forgot some of the words.

Leah: Yeah, my brother is in the 7th Grade chorus so my family went. Rachel: Did you see my solo? I was so nervous. Do you think it went okay?

I should be positive and say what I thought the good parts of her performance were. Yeah, you have a really great singing voice! Rachel: Thank you! I thought I messed up some of the words a little. Leah: That’s okay! Your voice sounded awesome! Rachel: Thank you! This time, Leah was honest but not too honest. She focused on the positive and told Rachel that she has a pretty voice. She kept the part about messing up the words in her head. That way, she didn't hurt any feelings. Rachel brought up the mistake on her own which is a much better way for them to talk about it.

The directions often have a few steps. Everyone in the class should follow the directions by themselves without needing help or reminders from the teacher. Make sure you’re paying attention anytime the teacher talks so you don’t miss a direction. First, we notice when the teacher is giving the entire class a direction. Next, focus on the key words so you don’t have to remember so many. Then, repeat the key steps to yourself one or two times. Get going right away on the first step. It’s never a good habit to avoid work. Check that you’re done before you move on to the next step. This is just a quick glance to make sure you didn’t forget something. Move through each step and make sure all steps are done before you put materials away or clean up. Being able to follow directions yourself can make you feel proud of yourself and your teacher will be proud of you. Let’s review. To follow directions without reminders: Notice when our teacher is talking to the class and listen to the directions. Focus on just the key words in the directions. Repeat the key words in your head. Think about what you need to do first. Check that you’re done with one step before moving on. It’s smart to look around at others if you aren't sure what to do. Let's see Shay learn to follow directions. Teacher: Okay, I need everyone’s attention for a minute. You guys are going to first check that your lead sentence is copied from your organizer. Then, check that you have dialogue in your paragraph. And last, you need quotation marks around your dialogue. Teacher: Shay, why haven't you gotten started? You haven’t written anything. Shay: I forgot the first direction so I couldn’t get started. Teacher: Sitting doing nothing is not an option. I’m really disappointed in you. What happened there? Shay wasn’t able to follow the directions, so he never started his work. Let’s see what they’re both thinking. Shay: I couldn’t remember the directions, so I panicked. Teacher: If Shay can’t follow the directions, I have to help him with every single step. That takes a lot of time away from the other students. Shay felt embarrassed that he forgot the directions and his teacher was disappointed in him. If he had repeated the steps in his head, he would have remembered them and been able to do his work. Let’s watch him try again. Teacher: Okay, I need everyone’s attention for a minute. You guys are going to first check that your lead sentence is copied from your organizer. Then, check that you have dialogue in your paragraph. And last, you need quotation marks around your dialogue. Shay: Copy lead sentence, check for dialogue, check for quotes. Shay: Those are actually three small steps. First, I need to copy the lead sentence. Shay: And done. Step 2, Check for dialogue. Where is it? There. That’s done. Last, I need to check for quotes. Teacher: Nice job, Shay. Let's see how this made everyone feel. Shay: I used to just wait for my teacher to help me, but now I can do it all on my own. It’s a lot faster this way. Teacher: I used to have to tell Shay every single step. I'm so proud that he can handle this work by himself now. Following directions takes some thinking. We repeat the steps in our head and do one at a time until they’re done. When we do this, we’re acting like an independent student and our teacher will be proud. So, what did we learn? To follow directions without reminders: Notice when our teacher is talking to the class and listen to the directions. Focus on just the key words in the directions. Repeat the key words in your head. Think about what you need to do first Check that you’re done with one step before moving on. "," - Teachers give their class directions all day long. The directions often have a few steps. Everyone in the class should follow the directions by themselves without needing help or reminders from the teacher. Make sure you’re paying attention anytime the teacher talks so you don’t miss a direction. First, we notice when the teacher is giving the entire class a direction. Next, focus on the key words so you don’t have to remember so many. Then, repeat the key steps to yourself one or two times. Get going right away on the first step. It’s never a good habit to avoid work. Check that you’re done before you move on to the next step. This is just a quick glance to make sure you didn’t forget something. Move through each step and make sure all steps are done before you put materials away or clean up. Being able to follow directions yourself can make you feel proud of yourself and your teacher will be proud of you. Let’s review. To follow directions without reminders: Notice when our teacher is talking to the class and listen to the directions. Focus on just the key words in the directions. Repeat the key words in your head. Think about what you need to do first. Check that you’re done with one step before moving on. It’s smart to look around at others if you aren't sure what to do. Let's see Shay learn to follow directions. Teacher: Okay, I need everyone’s attention for a minute. You guys are going to first check that your lead sentence is copied from your organizer.

In this video, we’re going to try to figure out how people are going to react to different situations. After each video, we’ll give you three choices. You have to guess which one is going to happen. This video is all about Conversation Drivers and Conversation Stoppers. Conversation Drivers drive a conversation. That means they get a conversation going or keep it moving in the right direction. Conversation Stoppers stop the conversation before it’s ready to end. In this video, we’ll try to guess what’s going to happen. Will the conversation continue or stop? Whenever we see this icon in the corner, we can stop and talk about the situation. Let’s get started! This time, we’ll focus on Mike. Let’s see how this conversation goes. Tyler: Hey, Mike! Mike: Hi! Tyler: What's up? Mike: Not much. You? Tyler: Not much. What do you think will happen next? Tyler will... Think Mike is upset. Continue the conversation. Yell at Mike. Tyler: Is something wrong? Mike: Nope! Tyler: Alright. See you later, I guess. Mike: Bye! Mike was looking at the ground during the conversation. This sent Tyler the message that something was wrong. Tyler: Is something wrong? Mike: Nope! When Mike said nothing was wrong, Tyler was confused and the conversation stopped. Tyler: Alright. See you later, I guess. Mike: Bye! When we are having a conversation, it’s important to make eye contact. This lets the other person know that we’re interested in talking to them. Josh and Christine are working when Christine wants to ask Josh about something. Let’s watch. Christine: Hmm... what could Josh and I talk about? I've heard him talk about snowboarding before. I could ask him about that! So, do you still snowboard? Christine and Josh weren’t talking about snowboarding. What do you think will happen with the conversation? Josh will… Be confused because they weren’t talking about snowboarding. Start talking about snowboarding. Start talking about the work they’re doing. Josh: Yeah, I actually went this weekend. It's been a really good winter for it. Christine: It sounds fun! I've never gone but I'd love to try it. Josh: You should! It's not as hard as you'd think. Josh was happy to talk about snowboarding because it’s an interest of his. Even though they weren’t talking about snowboarding, he wasn’t confused. Every conversation has to start somewhere! Can you remember any interests of the people in your class right now? Alessandra has something to say to Serena. Let’s see how this conversation goes. Alessandra: Hey, Serena. Can I ask you something? Serena: Sure. Alessandra: Are you sure? Because I can come back later. Serena: No, go ahead! Alessandra: Well, I was thinking, instead of hanging out on Friday... What do you think will happen next? Is Serena driving the conversation? Alessandra will think... She can continue talking. Serena is too busy to talk. Serena is mad at her. Alessandra: You know what, I'll just come back when you're not so busy. Serena: Alright. Alessandra thought Serena was too busy to talk to her and ended the conversation. Serena kept saying she wanted to talk... Serena: No, go ahead. But her body was sending Alessandra a different message. Her body and her eyes were facing away from Alessandra. When we have a conversation, we want to make sure we listen with our entire bodies. We listen with our ears, eyes, and bodies. Liz has a question to ask Josh. Let’s see what happens next. Liz: Are you coming to the football game tonight? Josh: Yeah. Liz: What time? We're all getting dinner before. Josh: Seven. Liz: Okay... Do you want to come? Josh: Yeah. Is Josh driving or stopping the conversation? Why? What do you think will happen next? Liz will feel… Excited to hang out with her friends. Happy that Josh can join the group. Less excited by Josh’s answers. Liz: Okay, just let us know. Josh: Okay. Josh gave Liz the answer she was looking for. Liz: What time? We're all getting dinner before. Josh: Seven. Liz: Okay... Do you want to come? Josh: Yeah. But because his answers were so short, she didn't think he was interested in talking. His body language and the length of his response was sending a message he didn’t even know! Maybe next time, Josh can answer with something like “Yeah, I’d love to go,” when Liz asks if he wants to go. Serena and Alessandra are talking about Spanish homework. Let’s watch. Serena: Didn't you think the Spanish homework was hard? It took me a really long time. Alessandra: I had trouble with it too. The vocab was so tough. Serena: I know, right? So, what are you up to this weekend? What do you think will happen next? Alessandra will... Be confused because they were talking about Spanish class. Keep talking about Spanish class. Talk about her weekend plans. Alessandra: I'm going out to eat with my family on Saturday. And then just hang in on Sunday. You? Serena: Nothing big planned. I was hoping to go to the movies. Alessandra: Cool! Serena drove the conversation, and Alessandra started talking about her weekend. Shifting the conversation is a great thing to do, but we should wait until the first conversation is over before we start talking about something else. After they talked about Spanish homework, the conversation stopped. Alessandra: I had trouble with it too. The vocab was so tough. Serena: I know, right? So, what are you up to this weekend? Alessandra: I'm going out to eat with my family on Saturday. And then just hang in on Sunday. You? Serena: Nothing big planned. I was hoping to go to the movies. Alessandra: Cool! Serena correctly figured out the conversation was over, and picked a good time to bring up a new topic. What do you think would have happened if Alessandra responded to Serena’s question about Spanish class with her weekend plans? This time, let’s look at Mike. He’s having a conversation with Tyler. Let’s see how it goes. Mike: Good morning, Tyler. Tyler: Good morning, Mike. What's up? Mike: Nothing much. I'm running a bit late. I had this huge zit I had to pop this morning. It was really gross. Tyler: Um... I didn't need to know that. What will Tyler think next? Tyler will think... He doesn’t want to talk about this anymore. About what he did this morning. He wants to know more. Tyler: That's so gross! I don't need to hear about Mike's zits. I don't want to talk about that! Uh... got to go. Bye! Mike: Bye! That definitely stopped the conversation. That wasn’t a good topic to talk about with friends. When we talk about our bodies like that, it might make some people feel uncomfortable or even sick. If there are questions we have or topics about our bodies we want to talk about, who can we talk to? Alessandra and Tyler are talking about weekend plans. Let’s see what happens when Tyler doesn’t know about the topic. Alessandra: Hey, Tyler. Tyler: Hey, Alessandra. How's your weekend? Alessandra: It was so fun! We went to a food truck festival! Tyler: What's that? I've never heard of it. Tyler doesn’t know anything about food trucks. Does that drive the conversation or stop it? What’s going to happen next? Alessandra will… Explain it to Tyler. Feel frustrated because Tyler doesn’t know. Change the subject. Alessandra: They have all these restaurants inside these big trucks. They're all parked downtown. Tyler: What kind of foods were there? Alessandra: There are sandwiches, some had pizza. Tyler: What was your favorite food? Alessandra: I definitely like the taco truck best. It was so good! Tyler: That sounds awesome! Tyler and Alessandra ended up having a really nice conversation. Even though he didn’t know about food trucks, he asked questions to learn, and Alessandra was excited to talk about it! Can you remember a time when someone was talking about something you had never heard of? Did you learn about it? Great job today, everyone! We learned a lot about conversation drivers and conversation stoppers! Some examples of conversation drivers are: Talking about other’s interests. Christine: Hmm...what could Josh and I talk about? I’ve heard him talk about snowboarding before. I could ask him about that. And asking questions. Tyler: What’s that? I’ve never heard of it. Some conversation stoppers are: Not listening with our bodies. Alessandra: You know what, I’ll just come back when you’re not so busy. Serena: Alright. And not saying enough. Liz: Okay... Do you want to come? Josh: Yeah. We want to try to be driving those conversations! See you next time! "," - Welcome to Guess What Happens Next.

In this video, we’re going to be deciding if people are Being Flexible or if they are Being Rigid. Being Flexible means that we can let changes happen, and not get upset.

When we’re being rigid, it’s hard to change our thoughts and feelings. Whenever we see this icon in the corner, we should pause and discuss the action. Is the person Being Flexible or Being Rigid?

That will help her keep control of her feelings and not be so rigid. The group is going to play a game, and Alessandra has a game she really wants to play. Let’s see what happens next. Alessandra: How about we play Bingo? That's my favorite game. Devin: We played Bingo last time. Let's play Sorry. Andrew: Yeah, let's play Sorry. Alessandra: That's not my favorite game but, okay, we can play Bingo another time. Serena: Okay, let's play! Bingo is Alessandra’s favorite game. When the rest of the group wanted to play something new, was Alessandra flexible or rigid? Alessandra did a great job being flexible. Even though she didn’t get what she wanted, she didn’t get upset, and she went along with what the rest of the group wanted. Can you think of a time where what you wanted to do was different from what everyone else wanted to do? How did you handle it? Bobby and Andrew are discussing their favorite sports. How does Andrew react when Bobby has a different favorite sport? Let’s see. Andrew: So, what’s your favorite sport? Bobby: I think basketball. Andrew: No way. Football is way better! Bobby: Well, I just like basketball better. I think it’s a more fun sport to play. Andrew: But in football, you get to tackle. Bobby: Yeah. I just have a different favorite sport. Andrew: But in football, you get to play outside. Bobby: Yeah, I don't know. Was Andrew being flexible or rigid? How did that make Bobby feel? When Bobby disagreed with Andrew, Andrew couldn’t accept that Bobby had a different opinion than him. He was being rigid. Andrew was being so rigid that it sounded like Bobby didn’t want to talk with him anymore. Bobby: Yeah, I don't know. Remember, everyone can have different opinions about things. My opinion might be different than your opinion, and that’s okay. Even if we have a different opinion than someone else, we should respect their point of view. What are some topics you could have an opinion about? In this video, Chris is really excited to play a game. But, there’s a problem. The group needs four players to play. When Alessandra comes by, Chris thinks she can be the fourth player. How does he react when she says she can’t play? Let’s see. Chris: Hey Alessandra, want to play with us? We need four players to play. Alessandra: Oh, I can't. I have to go study. Chris: Come on! Please? Alessandra: I really shouldn't. I have work to do. Chris: Come on! We can’t play without you! Bobby: Chris, come on. We can make it work with three people. Chris: No! We need four players to play! Do you think Chris was being flexible or being rigid? Chris was being rigid. He wouldn’t accept no for an answer, even though Alessandra told him two times that she couldn’t play. When Bobby tried to be flexible and play the game with three players, Chris yelled at him. That made the rest of the group uncomfortable. When someone tells you they don’t want to do something, you should accept their answer. If we continue to ask, we can make them feel annoyed and upset. Not everyone wants to do the same thing as us. The group is working on a class project and has to choose a country. Alessandra wants to do a different country than the rest of her group. How does she handle it when they disagree with her? Devin: Okay, we need to pick a country for our social studies project. I think we should do France. Serena: I like France. That sounds good. Andrew: France is great! Alessandra: Would you guys mind doing Spain? I really like Spain. Devin: I think we all want to do France. Alessandra: Alright. If everyone wants to do France, I guess that's okay. Was Alessandra being flexible or being rigid? Alessandra was flexible. She asked the group very nicely to do the country she wanted to do. Alessandra: Would you guys mind doing Spain? I really like Spain. She made a suggestion to the rest of the group, and even when they said no, she stayed calm and didn’t get upset. She said she would do what the rest of the group wanted, even though it wasn’t what she wanted. Great job being flexible, Alessandra! Two groups both want to use the basketball court. Chris and Andrew want to play basketball, and Christine and Julie are sitting near the hoop. Let’s see how Christine reacts when they ask her to move. Chris: Hey, could you guys move? We're trying to practice our lay ups. Julie: Yeah, but we’re using the court right now. Andrew: But we need the court to play. You can talk anywhere. Christine: That’s not fair! We're not moving. I’m going to stay right here. What do you think? Was Christine being flexible or was she being rigid? Christine was being rigid. Christine and Julie could have worked together with Chris and Andrew to compromise and come up with a solution that makes everybody happy. When Christine yelled, her tone of voice told the rest of the group that she didn’t want to compromise at all. Chrstine: That's not fair! We're not moving. I'm going to stay right here. She also turned her body away from Chris and Andrew, which told them she wasn’t interested in talking. If everybody works together, I bet they can come up with a solution that would make everyone happy. How do you think they can compromise to solve their problem? Serena and Andrew are hanging out when Andrew starts talking about dinosaurs. When it seems like Serena doesn’t want to talk about dinosaurs anymore, is Andrew flexible or rigid? Andrew: Did you know that a stegosaurus has a brain the size of a walnut? Serena: Yeah, you told me that before. Andrew: Did you know that birds are relatives of dinosaurs? And some can have up to 1,000 teeth! I watched this YouTube video called Gross Dinosaurs. It was so funny! What do you think? Was Andrew flexible or rigid? Andrew was rigid. His brain was stuck on dinosaurs, and he couldn’t talk about anything else. Serena was giving him signs she didn’t want to talk about dinosaurs. What were the signs that told us Serena wasn’t interested? When they were talking about dinosaurs, Serena’s tone of voice didn’t sound excited. Serena: Yeah, you told me that before. Her body was facing away from Andrew and she didn’t look up from her book. If Andrew can read the signs from Serena, he can be flexible and change the topic of conversation to something they both like. Not everyone likes the same thing so it’s important to shift what we’re talking about based on who we’re talking to. What different things do you talk about with these different people- your friends, your parents, and your teachers? Bobby, Alessandra, and Chris are talking about the movie they are going to see after school. Chris wanted to see a scary movie, but Alessandra and Bobby wanted to see a funny movie. How does Chris handle it? Alessandra: I know we said we'd see a scary movie but I’m in the mood for a funny movie. What do you guys think? Bobby: Hmm. Yeah. I don’t really want to see a scary movie anyways. A funny movie would be more fun. Chris: How about this? We'll see the movie you guys want today and then another day we can see my movie. Bobby: Yeah, we can do that. Alessandra: I promise we'll see the one you want. I'm just not in the mood today. Chris: Okay, cool! Was Chris flexible or rigid? Chris was flexible. His plans changed, but he was still able to adapt to the new situation. He didn’t get upset and made a compromise with his friends. Now everyone is happy, not just one person. Have you ever had a situation where your plans changed? How did it make you feel? How did you react? Great job, everyone! We learned a lot about Being Flexible and Being Rigid. Remember, Being Flexible means that we can handle changes without getting upset. Being Rigid means that changes upset us, and we don’t adapt our thoughts and feelings to the new situation. There are plenty of times we can work on being flexible, like when our schedule changes. Serena: But today is Monday and we always have gym on Monday! When we need to compromise with other people Christine: That’s not fair! We're not moving! I'm going to stay right here. Or when we need to change what we’re talking about. Andrew: Did you know that a stegosaurus has a brain the size of a walnut? Serena: Yeah, you told me that before. If we’re flexible, we can work with others when things change. This helps us in many ways like in school or with friends! See you next time! "," - Welcome to Two Sides a game where we compare how people act in different situations. In this video, we’re going to be deciding if people are Being Flexible or if they are Being Rigid. Being Flexible means that we can let changes happen, and not get upset. We can change how we think and feel to match the situation. Being Rigid means that we get upset or frustrated when things change or when people don’t want to do what we want. When we’re being rigid, it’s hard to change our thoughts and feelings. Whenever we see this icon in the corner, we should pause and discuss the action. Is the person Being Flexible or Being Rigid? Let’s focus on Serena. How does she react when she hears about the new schedule for the day? Alessandra: Do you guys know what we’re doing in gym class today? Bobby: We don’t have gym class today. We're going to an assembly. Serena: What?! Bobby: We're going to an assembly. Serena: But today is Monday and we always have gym on Monday! How was Serena feeling when she found out there was no gym glass today? Was she being flexible or being rigid? How do you know? Serena was being rigid. When the schedule for the day changed, she got very upset. When she started yelling, she made her classmates feel uncomfortable. When Serena starts feeling upset, she should try to stop and recognize how she’s feeling. She can use a strategy to calm down, like taking a deep breath.

M,Cyberbullying,M136,https://slp.everydayspeech.com/video/cyberbullying,3,3-4,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,Nov-19,,TEACHER SCRIPT: We're learning more about cyberbullying. What makes cyberbullying different from physical bullying?,Handling Teasing and Bullying,,,,,,https://res.cloudinary.com/everyday-speech/raw/upload/v1619172306/SubtitlesVTT/4JHvy6S2Ym_M136_Cyberbullying.vtt," - Cyberbullying is purposefully hurting someone’s feelings online through texting and social media. This can include spreading rumors, writing mean comments, posting pictures that embarrass others, or making fake accounts for someone. Cyberbullying can be just as hurtful as in-person bullying because the message can travel publicly and humiliate the target, or person being bullied. Often times, because the bully stays anonymous online, they write something meaner than they would have said in person. They don’t see how hurtful they’ve been. If you witness cyberbullying, you can decide to be an ally, an upstander, or a bystander. An ally supports the target. Their texts or online comments clearly support the person who was bullied. An upstander tries to stop the bully by texting or making online comments that directly call the bully out. This sends a message to the bully that others don’t support their actions. A bystander does nothing mean, but also does nothing to help the situation. We never want to be a bystander. Saying nothing does not help the person being bullied. If you are the target of cyberbullying, tell someone right away. It can be a difficult situation to deal with on your own, and an adult can help you handle it. We may witness cyberbullying or be cyberbullied. This is when others are hurtful online in texting or social media. Don’t be a bystander. If you witness cyberbullying, be an ally and an upstander who supports the person being bullied and stops the bully. Tell a trusted adult if you are being cyberbullied. Let’s see how Kiara acts when she sees Cyberbullying. Kiara: I don’t know, I have a soccer game to go to and then after, I'm going with my parents to... Liz: He's sleeping. Isaac: Gosh, he’s so weird. Liz: I'm going to post this. Kiara: That’s not funny. Don’t be mean. Liz: Oh come on, who cares? Kiara: I care. We aren’t going to be mean to people. Isaac: She’s right. I’d feel bad if other people saw that. Liz: Yeah, I guess that’d be pretty mean. Kiara: So anyway, after the soccer game in the afternoon, I’m going with my parents to see a movie. Kiara: When I see that someone is getting cyberbullied, I want to be an ally and an upstander. I support the person who is being targeted and I let the bully know they’re wrong. Kiara was an upstander and an ally to Jackson. She supported and defended Jackson while letting Liz know that her online behavior wouldn’t be okay. What did we learn? We may witness cyberbullying or be cyberbullied. Don’t be a bystander if you witness cyberbullying. Be an ally and an upstander who supports the person being bullied and stops the bully. Tell a trusted adult if you are being cyberbullied. "," - Cyberbullying is purposefully hurting someone’s feelings online through texting and social media.

At each step, we’ll talk about the problem, and how we can solve it. The steps we’ll go through are: Identify the problem - what’s wrong? Figure out how big the problem is. Think of possible solutions to the problem. Pick a solution. Try that solution and then reassess it. How did it work? If our solution works, our problem is solved! If our solution doesn’t work, we can try again. Problem solving is a process. We won’t always go straight to the solution. This video is all about problems we might have in our day to day lives. Whenever we see this icon in the corner, we can stop and talk about how everyone is feeling. Let's get started! It’s time for lunch when Liz realizes she has a problem. Teacher: Time for lunch! Let's head to the cafeteria. Liz: Oh no! I think I forgot my lunch money! What will I have for lunch? First, let’s identify the problem. What’s Liz’s problem? Liz: I didn't bring lunch or money today! Liz didn’t bring lunch and she has no money today! Her problem is that she has nothing to eat. How big is the problem? Liz: It's not a big deal, but I do need some help. Liz thinks this is a medium-sized problem. There are some easy solutions, but not having food isn’t a small problem. What are some solutions to Liz’s problem? Liz: Well, I could borrow money from a friend. I could talk to my teacher. Or I could just skip eating lunch today. You might have come up with different solutions, and that’s okay. The next step is to pick a solution. Should Liz Borrow Money, Talk to the Teacher, or Skip Lunch? Let’s watch Liz pick a solution. Liz: I don't want to bother anyone and I'm not that hungry. I'll just eat when I get home. Liz decided to just skip lunch. She’s not really hungry anyway. The final step is to try the solution and reassess. Let’s watch how Liz’s solution works. Teacher: Liz, are you okay? Liz: I forgot my lunch money, so I didn't eat lunch. I'm so hungry and I can't concentrate! Teacher: Next time, let me know. We can find a way to get you some lunch. Let’s reassess. Do you think Liz picked the best solution? Liz: If I could go back, I would pick a different way to solve my problem. I could have talked to my teacher or I could have borrowed money from a friend. Not eating was not a good solution to my problem. Liz ended up being really hungry in the afternoon. She was tired and couldn’t concentrate on her work. Not eating didn’t solve her problem.

Looking for clues in others’ body language, tone of voice, and people's actions can help you know how to act and what to say in different situations.

Justin: Hmm, yeah, you were telling me about this last week. Rachel: The show was all about large creatures. The blue whale can weigh over 200 tons. Justin: That's pretty big. I wonder what we're working on in art class. Rachel: And the blue whale is bigger than the dinosaurs. Isn’t that crazy? Justin: Yeah, crazy. Hmm... did Justin seem very interested in that conversation? Let's take a look at what he's thinking. Justin: Rachel is always telling me random animal facts. I don't want to be rude but I'm just not very into that topic. I wish we could talk about something else. Justin is not interested in the conversation about blue whales. Did he give Rachel any clues that he wanted to talk about something else? His tone of voice didn't sound very excited. He tried to change the subject, and by the end, he was looking away. Rachel missed all of these clues and kept talking. If Rachel noticed the clues, she could have changed the topic to something they both like. Let's watch Rachel try again.

Justin is asking about something new and he doesn't sound very interested in blue whales. Those are clues that he isn't that interested in what I'm saying. Maybe I can talk about something he likes. He just mentioned art class, so I can talk about that. So... have you finished your pottery yet? Justin: Oh, not yet. I'm finishing the painting today. I can't wait to see what it looks like. Rachel: Yeah, me too. This time, Rachel was able to read the clues that Justin gave. When she was talking about blue whales, Justin gave her some clues that he wasn't interested. These clues were: his tone of voice, his voice sounded flat and not interested; Justin: Yeah, you were telling me about this last week. His eyes. He was looking down. His actions. He changed the subject. Justin: I wonder what we're working on in art class. All of these clues told Rachel he wasn't interested. When she thought about something Justin likes and asked him about his art, he was much more excited. Now Rachel will remember to look at others and read the clues they are giving. If you can tell that someone does not want to continue the conversation, then you can talk about something new.

I wonder what we're working on in art class. Rachel: And the blue whale is bigger than the dinosaurs. Isn’t that crazy? Justin: Yeah, crazy. Hmm... did Justin seem very interested in that conversation? Let's take a look at what he's thinking. Justin: Rachel is always telling me random animal facts. I don't want to be rude but I'm just not very into that topic. I wish we could talk about something else. Justin is not interested in the conversation about blue whales. Did he give Rachel any clues that he wanted to talk about something else? His tone of voice didn't sound very excited. He tried to change the subject, and by the end, he was looking away. Rachel missed all of these clues and kept talking. If Rachel noticed the clues, she could have changed the topic to something they both like. Let's watch Rachel try again.

When this happens, we can compromise. It’s important to learn how to compromise because it solves problems quickly and keeps everyone happy. How do we compromise? The first step is knowing what to expect. Expect to get what you want some of the time, but not all of the time. We can’t always have things our way, or else our friends might not want to hang out or play with us. Next, know how to give something up for now. If one person gets their idea one time, then the other person can do their idea the next time. This is a fair compromise and gets the problem solved quickly. You can save your idea for later. Friends do this all the time.

No, Shay did not try to compromise or think about his friend. Let’s see how everyone is feeling. Niko: Shay is being so unfair. He wants everything his way. I don’t think I want to play with him anymore. Shay: I know Niko wants to be yellow, but I called it first. Shay was only thinking about what he wanted in this situation. This made Niko feel upset. It wasn’t very fun for Niko to play with Shay. How could Shay have compromised to solve the problem quickly and make everyone happy? Let’s watch him try again. Shay: I call being yellow! Niko: Wait, but I want to be yellow. Shay: Oh, and I call going first! Niko: No fair! You got to pick your color. Can I go first? Shay: I really want to go first and be yellow, but I can tell I’m making Niko upset. I can’t get everything I want all the time. Maybe I can give up one of the things I want to make Niko happy. Shay: You’re right. How about this time you can be yellow and I’ll go first? Niko: Okay! Shay: Awesome! Let’s play! How was this time different? Let’s see how they’re both feeling now. Niko: I’m happy Shay offered to let me be yellow. I’m excited to play now! Shay: I’m glad I compromised with Niko. I was still able to get part of what I wanted and also make Niko happy.

This is called Putting Yourself in Someone Else’s Shoes. Empathy helps us form friendships because it helps us connect with others. When others feel that you care about how they feel, they will feel closer to you in return. We can use the Empathy Essentials to learn this skill. First, we figure out how the person is feeling. Once you know how they’re feeling, you need to do an action to show you care. It’s not enough to just think about their feelings – we show them! We can say things like: “I know how you feel.” “I hate when that happens to me.” or “That must have been hard.” The Empathy Essentials include the following two steps: Figure out how the person is feeling. Show the person we understand their feelings and care about them by doing an action or saying something nice. Let’s see what happens when Kiara does not show empathy for her friend Maya. Maya: Hey, Kiara. Kiara: Hey, Maya! Maya: What’s up? Kiara: I’m so excited. I got invited to Johnny’s party. Are you going? Maya: Oh, I didn’t get invited. Kiara: Well, I heard there’s going to be games, pizza. We’ll maybe even watch a movie! Well, see you later! Maya: Alright. Bye. Did Kiara think about how Maya felt about not getting invited to the party? Let’s see what everyone is thinking. Maya: I’m so sad I didn’t get invited to Johnny’s party. And I really wish Kiara would stop talking about it so much. Kiara: I’m so excited about the party. I want to tell everyone how fun it’s going to be! Kiara didn’t notice that Maya felt sad that she didn’t get invited to the party. When Kiara kept talking about the party, it made Maya feel even more upset about missing out. Kiara didn’t read Maya’s mood. She did not read Maya’s body language or listen to her tone of voice. Let’s watch what happens when Kiara remembers to use her Empathy Essentials and notices how Maya is feeling. Maya: Hey, Kiara. Kiara: Hi, Maya! Maya: What’s up? Kiara: I’m so excited. I got invited to Johnny’s party. Are you going? Maya: Oh, I didn’t get invited. Kiara: Maya looks pretty sad about not getting invited to the party. I should probably stop talking about it. I remember when my friends made plans to see a movie without me and I felt upset about it. I’m going to try to say something to Maya to let her know I understand how she’s feeling. Kiara: Oh, I’m so sorry, Maya. I’m sure Johnny didn’t mean to leave you out. Maya: Yeah. Maybe. Kiara: We should totally hang out this weekend! We can go to the mall or see a movie or something. Maya: Yeah, that sounds fun! I’ll text you this weekend? Kiara: Sounds good! Bye! Maya: Bye! Let’s see what everyone is thinking. Maya: I was feeling sad about not getting invited to the party, but Kiara made me feel better. She’s a good friend. Kiara: It felt good to show Maya empathy because it made us closer as friends. That time, Kiara was able to use the Empathy Essentials to connect and feel closer with her friend, Maya. First, Kiara read Maya’s mood by looking at her body language. She saw Maya looking down with a sad look on her face. Kiara also listened to how Maya’s tone of voice changed when she said, “I didn’t get invited.” Then, Kiara thought about how the situation would make her feel. Kiara wouldn’t feel very good if she wasn’t invited to the party. She realized Maya probably felt sad. Next, Kiara thought about what she could say to try to make Maya feel better. She stopped talking about the party and changed the topic to plans that involved both of them. By using her Empathy Essentials, Kiara was able to show Maya that she understood how she felt. So, what did we learn? We can use empathy to show friends that we care about them, and to build stronger friendships.

Alessandra: Do you guys know what we’re doing in gym today? Bobby: We don't have gym today. We're going to an assembly. Serena: What? Bobby: We're going to an assembly. Serena: I’m feeling really uncomfortable. My stomach feels upset. That means I’m feeling nervous. I need to calm down. Today will be different, but I can go to gym tomorrow. I guess we’ll go to gym tomorrow. Great work, Serena! She solved her own problem. She was feeling upset because there was a change to her day. But she stopped, recognized her feelings, and used a strategy to calm down. She took a deep breath and remembered she will have gym tomorrow. Now she knows how to handle a change to her schedule. "," - Sometimes, we have changes to our days. These changes can make us feel nervous because we don’t know what’s going to happen. In life, things will change.

How much we share the conversation, what we talk about, and what tone we use when we correct someone are different ways we can affect a conversation.

We'll watch each situation and think about how the character's actions make everyone else feel. Each main character will come to a Social Fork, a time when they can control how the interaction will go. One path leads to others feeling positive about the situation, while another path might lead to negative outcomes. Your job is to pick the best path for each character. In this video, the fork is all about Conversation Drivers and Conversation Stoppers. When we drive the conversation, we start it or keep it going in the right direction. When we use a conversation stopper, we stop the conversation before it's ready to end naturally. Let's get started. Leah and Zach are talking about Zach's sneakers when Zach reaches a social fork. Leah: I like your sneakers, Zach. Zach: Thanks! I got them for my birthday. I always ask for sneakers on my birthday. I remember one year my brother got me two pairs. It was so awesome! Leah: Oh, that's cool... Zach: We were at the mall when we saw them. He bought me them and I didn't even know he got them. It was such a great present. Zach is at a social fork. On one side of the fork, he could take a break from talking. On the other side, he could continue talking. What do you think will happen down each path? Let's see how each path goes. First, we'll see what happens when Zach takes a break from talking. Leah: I like your sneakers, Zach. Zach: Thanks! I got them for my birthday. I always ask for sneakers on my birthday. I remember one year my brother got me two pairs. It was so awesome! Leah: Oh, that's cool... Zach: We were at the mall when we saw them. He bought me them and I didn't even know he got them. It was such a great present. Leah: Wow! My brother never gets me anything good. Zach: Really? Leah: Yeah. He's not the best at picking out presents. Zach: I guess I'm just lucky then. Let's see how Leah feels. Leah: That was a great conversation! I didn't know Zach loves sneakers so much. Now let's see how it goes when Zach continues to do all of the talking. Leah: I like your sneakers, Zach. Zach: Thanks! I got them for my birthday. I always ask for sneakers on my birthday. I remember one year my brother got me two pairs. It was so awesome! Leah: Oh, that's cool... Zach: We were at the mall when we saw them. I remember he bought them for me and I didn't even know he got them. It was such a great present. Leah: Well, I always... Zach: Aren't the colors so nice? There's neon ones at the store, but I like these ones better. Leah: Yeah... Zach: I think Nike is my personal favorite but I also own a few Reeboks. Let's see how Leah felt that time. Leah: Zach was going on and on about his sneakers. It was hard to get a word in. That didn't feel very good. Did those paths go the way you thought they were going to go? Which path would you pick? Taking a break from doing all the talking was the best path for Zach. This gave Leah a chance to talk as well. Why was taking a break from talking the best path for Zach? When we're in a conversation, we should try to talk in equal amount. When Zach did all of the talking, that stopped the conversation. Leah didn't feel like talking anymore. When he shared the conversation and listened to her, that drove the conversation in the right direction. Remember, in a conversation, we should try to share the talking evenly with the other person. In this scene, Justin and Zach are talking about a lunar eclipse. Let's see what happens. Justin: Do you know about the lunar eclipse? Zach: Yeah. You told me about it yesterday and the day before that. Justin: But it's happening real soon. Zach: Mm-hmm. Justin: Do you think you'll watch it? Zach: Probably not. Justin is at a social fork. On one side of the fork, he could talk more about the eclipse. On the other side, he could shift the topic. What do you think will happen down each path? Let's see how each path goes. First, we'll see what happens when Justin keeps talking about the lunar eclipse. Justin: Do you know about the lunar eclipse? Zach: Yeah. You told me about it yesterday and the day before that. Justin: But it's happening real soon. Zach: Mm-hmm. Justin: Do you think you'll watch it? Zach: Probably not. Justin: I know I will. I have an alarm set on my phone already. Have you ever seen one? Zach: No, I haven't. Justin: It's so cool though! Why haven't you ever seen one? Zach: I don't know. Let's see how Zach felt when Justin only talked about the lunar eclipse. Zach: Justin has told me about the lunar eclipse every day this week. I'm just not into that kind of stuff. Let's watch what happens when he chooses another path and switches the topic. Justin: Do you know about the lunar eclipse? Zach: Yeah. You told me about it yesterday and the day before that. Justin: But it's happening soon. Zach: Mm-hmm. Justin: Do you think you'll watch it? Zach: Probably not. Justin: Oh, alright. How's soccer been going? I've heard you've been practicing a lot. Zach: Yeah. I've been working so hard. The team's looking really good. Justin: That's awesome! Zach: Yeah. We've got a couple of tough games coming up. Justin: Good luck! Let's see how Zach felt when Justin picked a new topic. Zach: I'm glad we got to talk about things we both like instead of just his favorite things. Did those paths go the way you thought they are going to go? Which path would you choose? Changing to a new topic was the best path for Justin. How come? When we only talk about our interest, that can be a conversation stopper. It's okay to talk about things we're interested in, but if that's all we talk about, other people may not want to continue the conversation. If we take the time to think about what other people are interested in, we can drive the conversation. Thinking about what others are interested in and talking about that is a great way to get people excited about the conversation. Remember to think about what other people like and make sure you aren't always talking about just your interest. In this scene, Leah and Rachel are talking about their project when Leah reaches a social fork. Leah: How's your research paper coming? Rachel: Good. I finished my five pages. Now I just have to edit. Leah: I know the paper has to be eight pages. She got the number of pages confused. Leah is at a social fork. On one side of the fork, she could indirectly correct Rachel. On the other side, she could directly correct Rachel. What do you think will happen down each path? Let's see how each path goes. First, we'll watch Leah use an indirect way. Leah: How's your research paper coming? Rachel: Good. I finished my five pages. Now I just have to edit. Leah: I know the paper has to be eight pages. She got the number of pages confused. Leah: Um... I'm pretty sure that Mrs. Hopkins said that it had to be eight pages. I could be wrong though, so let me check. Rachel: Oh, I thought she said five pages. Leah: Yeah. It says here that it has to be eight pages. Rachel: Good thing you told me. Leah: I just wanted to be sure that you knew. Let's see how Rachel feels after Leah corrected her indirectly. Rachel: I'm glad Leah told me how many pages the paper had to be. That was really helpful. Now let's see what happens when Leah uses a different strategy to correct Rachel. Leah: How's your research paper coming? Rachel: Good. I finished my five pages. Now I just have to edit. Leah: I know the paper has to be eight pages. She got the number of pages confused. It has to be eight pages long. You're not done. Rachel: Oh, I thought it had to be five pages. Leah: No, it definitely has to be eight pages. Rachel: Oh... Let's see how Rachel felt when Leah directly corrected her. Rachel: Leah made me feel like I was stupid. That didn't feel very good. I just made a mistake. Did those paths go the way you thought they were going to go? Which path would you choose? Using an indirect way was the better path for Leah to take. Why was correcting Rachel indirectly the best path for Leah? Sometimes directly correcting someone can hurt people's feelings and stop the conversation. Correcting someone indirectly is a softer way of saying something and can help drive the conversation. There are times we should directly correct someone like during an emergency, or if we have to correct them quickly. If it's not that important, we can use an indirect way of correcting to make them feel better about being corrected. We saw a few examples of conversation drivers and conversation stoppers. We saw how sharing the conversation drives it and how only talking about our interests can stop a conversation, as well as how indirectly correcting someone can spare someone's feelings and keep a conversation going. Think about if you come to a social fork when you're having a conversation. If it's not going the way you expected, did you use a conversation stopper? Can you think of a conversation driver you can use to get the conversation moving again? "," - Welcome to Fork in the Road, a game where you see where two different behaviors will take you.

People bully to feel more powerful than others. There are four different kinds of bullying. The first kind of bullying is Verbal Bullying. That can be making fun of someone, threatening, name calling, or inappropriate comments. The second kind of bullying is Physical. That’s any kind of touching, hurting, spitting, tripping, taking your things, or rude gestures. The third kind of bullying is Social. This is leaving others out, telling others not to talk to someone, embarrassing others in public, or spreading rumors. The fourth kind of bullying is Cyber. That can be hurtful messages, spreading rumors online, leaving mean comments, posting pictures that embarrass others, or making fake accounts for someone. Always tell a trusted adult when you feel you or anyone else is being bullied. Bullying is when someone repeatedly tries to hurt someone’s feelings, or control them in some way. There are four kinds of bullying: Verbal bullying uses words. Physical bullying uses touching. Social bullying excludes others. Cyber bullying happens online. Let’s take a look at some of the different types of bullying. These students are having a discussion with their teacher about the different types of bullying. See if you can help them figure out what type of bullying they have each experienced. Teacher: Now that we've learned about the different types of bullying, does anybody have an experience they'd be willing to share? Logan: I have one. Listen to Logan's bullying story. Try to decide what type of bullying happened to him. Logan: So, one time, when I was in the sixth grade, I rode the bus to school. These two older boys thought it’d be funny if they pulled on the hook of my backpack when I was trying to get off the bus. They’d pull me left to right, side to side, and one time they even tripped me. I tried to avoid them, but they still always found me. I hated riding the bus. Isaac: What did you do about it? Logan: Eventually I told my mom and my mom called his mom. He apologized to me the next day. And then we just didn't talk after that. What type of bullying happened to Logan? He was physically bullied. Students on his bus touched and pulled his backpack. Anytime someone is touching you, that's physical bullying which is not okay. What do you think Logan should have done? Let’s hear another one. Liz: I have one. When I was in fourth grade, a couple of the girls at my lunch table started making fun of this one girl’s lunch because she brought Indian food. They would say things like, “Eww! That's so gross! Get it away from me!” And she would say, “I don’t make fun of your food,” but these two girls just kept going every day until eventually she told the teacher. I never said anything mean, but the whole table had to apologize to her. I wish I had stood up for her. I mean, I was on her side, but I didn’t say anything. What type of bullying did Liz see? She saw verbal bullying at her lunch table. Verbal bullying is when someone says mean things over and over. Liz felt badly that she never stuck up for the girl being bullied. What do you think she should have done? Let’s hear another. Kiara: I guess I can go next. A girl I thought I was friends with asked for the passcode to my phone. She said she had all her other friends’ passcodes, so I gave it to her. I started noticing comments on other people’s pictures that didn't come from me but it seemed like it was. She wrote things like “I wish I could be as cool as you” or “Want to be friends? Because I don't have any.” I told my older sister and she told me to set a new password. Isaac: Weren't people mad at you? Kiara: I don't think so. I just had to tell everyone she wrote it all. What type of bullying happened to Kiara? She was cyber bullied. This happens anytime someone is making mean comments or using social media to hurt others over and over again. What would you do if this happened to you? Let’s hear one more. Isaac: In third grade, this one kid just didn’t like me. He told all of my friends not to let me play with them, so no one would talk to me or play with me at recess. I played alone a lot. After a couple of months, it stopped. And I guess he stopped telling them or maybe they stopped listening to him. Maybe I should have told the teacher or my parents or something. It might not have gone on so long. What type of bullying happened to Issac? Issac was bullied socially. Social bullying happens in a group when they leave some people out. What do you think Issac should have done in this situation? Teacher: Thanks for sharing, guys. I think it's really helpful for us all to hear that this could happen to anybody and we can learn ways to make it stop. Learning about different kinds of bullying helps us identify it when it’s happening so that we can react in the best way. Sometimes, we need to tell an adult. Sometimes, you need to stick up for yourself or others. Bullying is when someone repeatedly tries to hurt someone’s feelings, or control them in some way.

We call these Conversation Drivers. These are behaviors that drive or keep a conversation going. Some Conversation Drivers are: We use eye contact and body language to show we are interested and listening. We make connected comments which means our comments connect back to the other person’s. We share the conversation by giving an equal amount of talking time to everyone. We all share the talking and listening time. Let’s watch how to use Conversation Drivers. Kiara: Hey, Eric. Have you seen the new stuff in the art room? Eric: No, not yet. What did they get? Kiara: The school got a new pottery wheel and nice easels. Eric: Aww, that’s so cool! I can’t wait to go to art class on Thursday. Kiara: Yeah, I think classes will be really fun now. Eric: What do you want to try first? Kiara: Painting. Definitely painting! Eric: I love painting. Pottery would be really fun too! Kiara: Yeah, I love pottery, too. Let’s see how Kiara was feeling about that conversation. Kiara: I had a nice time talking with Eric. I’d like to talk to him again soon. Eric: When I want to drive the conversation and keep it going, I make sure to look at who I’m talking to and follow where they look. I also like to nod to show the person I’m listening. I listen to what Kiara says and make sure my comments connect back to hers. And I make sure to give the other person the same amount of turns to talk. To keep a conversation going, there are lots of Conversation Drivers we can use.

Why do you think it’s valuable to be able to solve your problems on your own?,Solving a Problem,,,,,,https://res.cloudinary.com/everyday-speech/raw/upload/v1619186997/SubtitlesVTT/SEL27_Problem_Solving_Steps.vtt," Problem-solving is a complex skill that involves following steps to find solutions to our problems. These methods include learning how to understand a problem and coming up with an action plan or a solution. As we get older, we will encounter new and more challenging problems. This includes problems at school and at home, like shifts in friend groups and disagreements with parents. Self-Reflection Can you think of some problems you have been faced with in the last week? How did you approach those problems? To help us be better problem-solvers, we can use the Problem-Solving Steps. These steps help us solve problems quickly and independently. To solve a problem, we: Identify the problem. The truth of the problem is often in the middle between two disagreeing people. Each person is partly right and partly wrong. Figuring out exactly how each person is right and wrong is part of identifying the problem. Think about the size of the problem. Is it a small or big problem? We can solve small problems quickly and by ourselves. Bigger problems may take longer or more people to solve them. We may need adults when safety is a concern. Come up with a few solutions. Stop and think about the different ways we could solve our problem. Predict what could go right or wrong with each solution as you play it out in your head. Pick the best solution. As you think each solution through, decide what you would say and do, and how that would make others feel. We pick solutions that help the most people. Test our solution. After we try a solution, we ask ourselves, “Is my problem solved?” Your feelings will tell you everything you need to know. We’ll feel relieved when the problem is solved. If there aren’t good feelings, or we find ourselves avoiding a situation or a person, we know we haven’t finished solving the problem. If that happens, try other solutions or get advice from an adult. Teachers, pause here to discuss and review the problem-solving steps with your class. For extra practice, try this one out. A group of your friends plan to see a movie this weekend. One friend is deaf and needs closed captioning to be able to understand the movie. You try to tell your friends about this, but they don’t listen. Practice At times, we may want to ask a teacher or parent for help. It is normal to feel unsure of ourselves when we try solving our own problems. Keep practicing and feel free to talk through your ideas with a trusted adult. Take initiative When problems aren’t an emergency, it’s a good idea to brainstorm and try your own solutions before you ask an adult for help. This shows that you can take initiative. It’s a great first step to becoming a problem solver. Work smarter When we become better problem-solvers, we learn how to work smarter, not harder. Students with strong problem-solving skills are successful in school and in everyday life. DISCUSSION: Why are problem-solving skills important?

In this video, we're going to try to figure out how people are going to react to different situations. After each video, we'll give you three choices. You have to guess which one is going to happen. This video is all about tuning into your environment. This means that you take time to notice: What is happening right now. What you're doing or planned to do in this moment - your actions, and think about how those actions will make others around you feel. If you're noticing your own actions and the actions of others around you, you're tuned in to what's happening. We're going to watch how our characters act in different situations and think about if they are tuning in or not. While watching, ask yourself: Do the characters seem to notice what's happening around them? Do they stop to think about their actions? In your own life, you can think about if you tune in to your actions. Are you doing any actions that might make others feel upset or uncomfortable? Now we're ready to see who is tuning in. Whenever you see this icon in the corner, we can stop and talk about the situation. Let's get ready to watch! Let's focus on Leah as she tells Rachel about her favorite Shakespeare plays. Rachel: Have you read Romeo and Juliet yet? I loved it! Leah: Ugh! I don't get why people love it so much. It's so boring! Rachel: Oh. Well... I liked it. Leah: Actually, real Shakespeare fans say Hamlet is way better. How do you think Rachel is going to react? Rachel will... Think Leah knows a lot about Shakespeare. Agree that Hamlet is better. Feel annoyed with Leah. Rachel: Oh, okay... Whatever you say. Rachel got annoyed with Leah. When Leah was telling Rachel about her opinion, Leah acted like her opinion was the only right one and she knew more about Shakespeare than Rachel. When we want to tell people our opinion, we should stop and tune in to the situation. Think about how your voice sounds and the words you use. Also stop to tune in to how the person feels. Are you going to hurt their feelings by disagreeing with their opinion? Other people may get annoyed or even offended if we speak to them in a condescending tone of voice. It's okay for Leah to state her opinion, but she should tune in to the message she's sending with her tone of voice and think about how it makes others feel. Say the sentence, ""I like Hamlet better than Romeo and Juliet,"" once in your usual tone of voice and once in a condescending tone. How does your voice change? Does the message change? Now you're tuning in to how your words can make people feel. In this video, Justin, Rachel, and Zach are playing a game. Let's focus on Justin. Rachel: I haven't played this in so long. Justin: I play it all the time. Rachel: So, who goes first? The youngest? Justin: Actually, anyone can go first. We just pick someone. Zach: Sounds good! Rachel, why don't you go first? Rachel: Okay. Justin: Don't you know the rules? You can't move yet. You have to get a 1 or a 2 first. Rachel: Oh... I forgot some rules. Zach: It's okay. Justin: No, no, no! You can't slide on your own color! Why don't you guys follow the rules? Zach: But I always play you slide on your own color. Justin: Well, that's wrong! Rachel: It doesn't matter to us. Just let him slide. Justin: No! How do you think Rachel and Zach are going to react? They will... Listen to Justin's rules. Stop playing with Justin. Ignore Justin. Zach: I really don't want to play anymore. Zach and Rachel didn't want to play the game with Justin anymore. He was so stuck on the rules that he took the fun out of the game. Justin wasn't tuned in to his actions and how he was making his friends feel. If he stopped to think about what Zach and Rachel were saying, he would have realized that the rules weren't that important to them. We have to tune in to every situation we're in because when we play a game with others, it's never the same. Sometimes, the group takes the game very seriously and everyone cares about the rules. Other times, they might just be playing for fun and not take it so seriously. We should tune in and pay attention to how the group feels so we know how serious to be. In this video, Justin is coming in to the classroom when Leah offers to help. Leah: Let me help you with that. Justin: Thanks! How do you think Justin will be feeling next? Justin will feel... Annoyed because he didn't need help. Embarrassed that someone needed to help him. Grateful that Leah helped him. Justin: That was really nice of Leah to help. I didn't want to ask, but I was struggling. Justin was grateful that Leah helped him. Justin didn’t want to bother Leah so he didn't ask for help, but she was able to tune in to the situation and notice when Justin was struggling anyway. People don't always ask you for help, but if we stayed tuned into what's happening and their body language, we can tell if they need help. Have you ever needed help but didn't want to ask for it? How could you tell if someone else needed help? In this video, Haley and Madison are talking. Let's focus on how Haley is feeling. Haley: Hey, did you hear about the trip next month? We're going to the Science Museum. Madison: The Science Museum? I love the Science Museum! Haley: I know! We love going together! Madison: They have an Ice Age exhibit and a Virtual Reality room! Haley: My favorite part... Madison: It's going to be awesome! I love the Science Museum! Haley: Me too... What do you think Haley will be thinking? Haley will think... Madison is frustrating her. She has a lot in common with Madison. She wants to sit with Madison on the way to the museum. Haley: I was trying to talk to Madison, but she kept interrupting. I couldn't say anything. It was really frustrating. Haley was frustrated by Madison. Madison was so excited about the trip to the Science Museum that she wasn't tuned in to see that Haley was trying to talk too. When we're talking to someone, we tune into them and the conversation. This lets us know how they're feeling and if the conversation is going well. We want to share conversations 50-50 with the other person. If we talk for most of the conversation, the other person might get frustrated or upset because they aren't able to get any words in. We should try to tune in to notice how much we're talking. In this video, Rachel and Justin are talking about Justin's karate tournament. Let's focus on Justin to figure out what will happen next. Rachel: How did your karate tournament go? Justin: Not too good. Rachel: Oh... What happened? Justin: I'll tell you later. Rachel: Justin is looking away from me and his body language seems pretty sad. I shouldn't keep asking what happened at the tournament. That would make him feel even worse. I should change the subject. I heard they're making lasagna on cooking class. How do you think Justin will be feeling next? Justin will feel... Confused because they were talking about karate. Happy to change the subject. Upset because he doesn't like lasagna. Justin: Yeah! I've been waiting for that all day. Rachel: It's going to be so good. Justin was happy that Rachel changed the subject. Rachel did a great job of tuning in to their conversation and realizing that Justin didn't want to talk about his karate tournament anymore. She tuned into his body language and tone of voice. When Justin said ""not too good,"" his voice was low, his shoulders were slumped and he turned away from Rachel. Justin: Not too good. Rachel: Oh... When Rachel asked what happened, he looked away from Rachel and down. These were clues that he didn't want to talk about the karate tournament anymore. Once Rachel tuned into the clues Justin gave her, she was able to realize that she should change the subject. What are some other clues you could tune in on that tell you someone doesn't want to talk about something? In this video, Rachel is looking for somewhere to sit. Let's see what happens next. Leah: Sorry. How do you think Rachel will feel? Rachel will feel... Confused as to why Leah moved all the stuff. Happy that Leah made some space for her. Angry with Leah that she took all the room in the first place. Rachel: Leah looked really busy. I didn't want to interrupt her, but I needed a place to sit. I'm glad she noticed me. Rachel didn't want to bother Leah, so she was happy that Leah moved her things without Rachel asking. Rachel was indirectly sending Leah a message when she was hanging around the table and looking at the chairs. This means that she didn’t say anything, but used her actions to send a message. Leah was tuned into the situation and able to understand that message. This helped her notice Rachel and figure out what she needed to do. If she hadn't been tuned in and ignored Rachel, that would have been really rude. Have you ever been in a situation where someone wasn’t tuned into the clues you were sending them? How did it make you feel? Great job, everyone! We learned a lot about how our behaviors can impact other people and the difference it makes when we're tuned into our behaviors or not. We saw what it looked like when our characters were tuned in to their surroundings and how their actions make others feel. We saw Leah tune in and help Justin when he was struggling. Rachel tune into Justin's feelings and change the subject when he didn't want to talk about the karate tournament. Leah tune into Rachel and give her a space to sit. We also saw what it looked like when they weren't tuned in and how this made people upset or uncomfortable. Leah didn't tune into her actions when she made Rachel feel bad by using a condescending tone of voice. Justin didn't tune into the group's mood when he took a game too seriously. And Madison didn't tune into the conversation to notice she was talking over Haley. Try to think about tuning into your actions and how you make others feel. What did we learn? To tune in, we: Look at what is happening right now. Think about our actions. And think about how those actions will make others around you feel. This will help you tune in and make the best choices.

We're going to watch how our characters act in different situations and think about if they are tuning in or not. While watching, ask yourself: Do the characters seem to notice what's happening around them? Do they stop to think about their actions? In your own life, you can think about if you tune in to your actions. Are you doing any actions that might make others feel upset or uncomfortable? Now we're ready to see who is tuning in. Whenever you see this icon in the corner, we can stop and talk about the situation. Let's get ready to watch! Let's focus on Leah as she tells Rachel about her favorite Shakespeare plays.

Small talk is a short conversation you have when you see someone you know. This sends a message that you’re friendly and gives them positive thoughts about you. We usually make small talk when we see someone before school or at an event like a party. A good way to start the conversation is using The Two W’s. The Two W’s include the Weather and the Weekend. It’s easy to talk about the weather. You look outside and make a comment about what you see. The weekend is easy to talk about too because there has either just been one or there is one coming up. If we don’t make small talk when we see people, they might feel upset or hurt. To know how to make small talk, use the Two W’s: the Weather and the Weekend. Some phrases we can use are: It’s so nice out! It’s so cold out! I’m looking forward to next weekend. What did you do last weekend? Let’s watch how Eric makes small talk when he sees his friend at school. Eric: Simon is coming over to talk to me. What should I say? It’s easy to talk about the weather, I’ll start with that.

Simon: I’m glad I chatted with Eric for a bit. I like talking to him. I’ll probably chat with him next time I see him. Eric: When I see a friend or classmate and we have a little bit of time to talk, I make small talk with them. I use the Two W’s to help me think of what to say. We can always talk about the weather. I make a comment about what I see outside. This is an easy topic for anyone to talk about. When we see people we know, we usually make small talk with them. Small talk is a short, polite conversation you have when you see someone. If we don’t make small talk when we see people, they might feel upset or hurt. So, what did we learn?

The air is no longer clear but filled with your color. Your world is now a calming color. Take a deep breath in and breathe in that relaxing color. See the color filling up your lungs as you breathe in. Notice the calmness in your mind. Now, take a second to imagine the color of stress, like a bright red. This color gives you the opposite feeling of calm or relaxed. As you breathe out, breathe out that stressful color. Watch as the color of stress disappears with each calming breath in... ... and out. If your mind is wandering to other thoughts, gently bring it back to your color. Take a few more deep breaths in and out on your own. Calm color in... stressful color out.

There are different levels of people in our lives. Depending on how long we’ve known them, there are actions we should or should not do. The Relationship Ruler can help us figure out how to act around different levels of people. We’re often closest with our family. We’re around them all the time. We share more about our lives and can physically touch or hug them. The next level is our closest friends. These are the friends we’ve known the longest. We hang out and talk with them outside of school many times a week. Next, we have our friends. These are people we’ve known for a while because it takes time to build friendships. We talk and hangout with these people outside of school. Then, we have acquaintances. These are people we know a little. We might be in the same class and have had a couple conversations with them, but we don’t talk a lot. Lastly, there are strangers. These are people we don’t know at all. It’s important to be safe around strangers. We only talk to them if someone you know introduces you. Let’s see what it looks like when Jackson uses his relationship ruler.

I better get started. Jackson: When I see other people, I use the Relationship Ruler to think about how close we are. Andy is a close friend. We always try to mess each other up when we’re playing games, so I know it’s okay. This is a special way we joke around, but only with each other, and I know it won’t make him upset. Kai is more of an acquaintance. I sit next to him in school, but we don’t talk very often. I usually say good morning, or if I have a question about school, I’ll ask him. I wouldn't roughhouse or joke around with Kai. That would feel weird. I change the way I act depending on where the person is on the Relationship Ruler. Jackson was able to use the Relationship Ruler to know how to act around different people. When he saw his close friend, Andy, he joked around and tried to mess up his game. Some friends might get upset at this, so he wouldn't do it to everyone. This is a special joke they share, that they know is okay to do with each other without hurting each other's feelings. So, what did we learn? The levels of relationships are: Family - Closest with. Can hug and share. Close friends - Known a long time. Hang out a lot. Friends - Talk and hang out a little bit. Acquaintances - Only know them a little. Strangers - Don't know them at all.

Every time we eat with others, there are some rules we all need to pay attention to. We call these the Restaurant Rules. Even if we're eating at someone's house and not a restaurant, we follow the same rules. Using the Restaurant Rules means we pay attention to our self-control, hygiene, and manners. Self-Control means keeping our body and our emotions calm. We stay in our seat, we are careful when reaching for things, and we make sure our voice isn't too loud. Hygiene means cleanliness, so we wash our hands, never touch anyone else's food, and use a napkin. Manners means making sure we use polite actions. We show respect, say please and thank you, and ask to be excused if we need to leave the table. Let's watch what happens when Madison forgets to follow the Restaurant Rules. Madison: I'm so excited to sleepover. We can stay up and watch YouTube. Liz: Sounds fun! Madison: Have you seen the videos where they make glitter slime? Liz: Um... yeah. Madison: Oh my gosh! I want to make some! Leah: I think the whole neighborhood knows that you want to make slime. Which Restaurant Rule did Madison forget to follow? She didn't use her self-controller. How did this make Liz feel? Liz: I didn't know why Madison started yelling about slime videos. That was weird. Liz felt confused. She didn't know why Madison was yelling.

Liz: I'm going shopping with my cousins. Madison: Fun! Are you going to eat that? Liz: Um... I wasn't planning on it. Madison: Great! Which Restaurant Rule did Madison forget to follow? She didn't use good hygiene. What do you think Liz was thinking now? Liz: I would never take food from someone else's plate. That spreads germs. This made Liz feel grossed out. We never touch other's food or take things off their plate. Madison should only eat food from her plate and remember to think about having good hygiene. Let's see what happens next. Leah: Do you guys want some cookies? I made them myself from scratch. Madison: Uh... They look kind of burnt. I don't want any. Leah: Oh, okay. No problem. Liz: I'll try some. Leah: Okay, sure. Which Restaurant Rule did Madison forget to follow? She didn't use her manners. How do you think this made Leah feel? Leah: It didn't feel very good when Madison said the cookies looked burnt. I spent a lot of time making them. Madison hurt Leah's feelings and upset her. When we're at someone's house and they offer us something, it's polite to say yes or to give a polite reason why we're saying no. Madison could have said, ""They look good, but I'm full."" That way she wouldn't have hurt Leah's feelings. When we're eating at a friend's house or with other people, we need to remember the Restaurant Rules. These rules help make sure everyone feels comfortable and happy during meals. When Madison forgot to use these rules, she made Liz and Leah feel upset and uncomfortable. What did we learn? Using the Restaurant Rules means we pay attention to our self-control, hygiene, and manners. Self-Control means keeping our body and our emotions calm.

This can make us feel frustrated and want to give up. We need to keep trying even if something is hard so we can learn new things and get better. Instead of thinking “I can’t do this,” try to tell yourself positive messages like “I can keep trying, I can do it.” Staying positive helps us keep an open mind, so we can figure out strategies to help us. Whenever we’re having a hard time, we can use positive thinking. We make sure to stay calm. Tell yourself positive thoughts like “I can do this” and “It will be okay.” Come up with strategies to help you when things are hard. Let’s watch Haley learn how to keep trying when things get hard. Haley: Wow, your drawing looks really good. Connor: Thanks! Haley: My drawing doesn’t look good at all. Connor: I think it’s fine. Haley: Well... maybe if I tried to color this in a little more. Haley: Ugh! Now it looks even worse! Haley: I don’t want to do this anymore! When Haley had a tough time, she wanted to give up. Did this solution solve her problem? Let’s see what Haley is thinking. Haley: I’m so bad at this. I know we’re supposed to finish them and turn them in but I don’t want to. I just want to give up. Haley felt frustrated that her drawing did not come out the way she wanted. This is a small problem that made her feel very upset. She told herself she is bad at coloring. This only made her want to stop and give up. We can solve small problems ourselves by keeping an open mind and positive attitude. We can use positive thinking to come up with strategies to deal with something that is hard. Let’s watch Haley try again. Haley: Wow, your drawing looks really good. Connor: Thanks! Haley: My drawing doesn’t look good at all. Connor: I think it’s fine. Haley: Well... maybe if I tried to color this in a little more. Haley: Ugh! Now it's even worse! I hate drawing! It’s not a big deal. I don’t have to be the best at everything. It takes practice to get good at something. I bet I can fix it. That looks better. Connor: Yeah, not bad! Haley: Thanks! Haley was able to change her thinking, from telling herself she can’t do it to telling herself she can. This is called using positive thinking. You tell yourself you can do it and find strategies that will help you. Haley knew that not liking her drawing was a small problem, so she stayed calm and used positive thinking to keep trying even when it was hard. If Haley gave up, she would feel bad about herself and get a poor grade. That would make the problem worse. But by staying positive and trying to think of a strategy to get better instead of giving up, Haley was able to complete her project. What did we learn? Whenever we’re having a hard time, we can use positive thinking. We make sure to stay calm. Tell yourself positive thoughts like “I can do this.” and “It will be okay.” Come up with strategies to help you when things are hard. "," - There may be times when something is difficult for us.

Depending on how long we’ve known them, there are actions we do or don’t do. For example, we wouldn’t hug someone we barely know, but we can hug our family or closest friends. We also share more things about our lives with people we’re closest with. The Relationship Ruler can help us figure out how to act around different people. We are often closest with our family. We’re around them all the time so they usually know the most about us. The next level is our closest friends. There’s a difference between close friends that you’ve known a long time and regular friends that you might see once in a while. Close friends are the friends we’ve known the longest. We hang out and talk with them outside of school many times a week. We can share personal details about our lives with them. Then, we have our friends. We talk and hangout with these people outside of school every once in a while. Next, we have acquaintances. These are people we know a little. We might be in the same class and have had a couple conversations with them, but we don’t talk a lot. Lastly, there are strangers. These are people we don’t know at all. It’s important to be safe around strangers. We only talk to them if someone you know introduces you. Let’s see how to use the Relationship Ruler to figure out different levels of friendships. Simon: My mom just had surgery and I feel like I want to talk to someone about it. Who should I talk to? Brandon is sitting right here, so I’ll tell him. Simon: Hey, Brandon. Brandon: Hey, Simon. What's up? Simon: My mom's going to get surgery on her foot. Brandon: Really? Simon: Yeah. She hurt her foot a long time ago, now she has to get surgery on it. Brandon: Wow, is she going to be okay? Simon: It’s fine. She has to stay in bed for a whole week now. Brandon: Okay. What happened there? Was this the best topic for an acquaintance? Let’s see how Brandon was feeling. Brandon: Why is Simon telling me about his mom’s foot surgery? We don’t even talk that much, and I barely even know him. I’ve never even met his mom. Simon did not use his Relationship Ruler. Simon made Brandon feel uncomfortable and surprised when he told him very personal information about his mother. These were private details about Simon’s mother that we shouldn’t share with acquaintances. Let’s watch when Simon does use the Relationship Ruler to figure out who to talk to about this. Simon: My mom just had surgery and I feel like I want to talk to someone about it. Who should I talk to? Jackson is one of my closest friends, so I’ll tell him. Simon: Hey, Jackson. Jackson: Hey, Simon. How are you? Simon: I'm good, but I just found out that my mom is going to have surgery on her foot. Jackson: Oh, is she okay? Simon: Yeah, she's fine. She hurt her foot a long time ago and she needs to get surgery on it. Jackson: Well, I’m glad she’s okay. Are we still allowed to hang out at your house later? Simon: Oh yeah, totally. But my mom needs to stay in bed for a while. We can still hang in our basement. Jackson: Simon is one of my close friends. I know his mom. I hope she's okay. That time, Simon was able to use the Relationship Ruler to figure out who to talk to about his mom’s surgery. He realized that it would make an acquaintance feel uncomfortable if you tell them something personal, but it’s okay to talk to a close friend about this. If we act the same way to our closest friends as we do to people we don’t know that well, it will make others feel confused or uncomfortable, so we choose what we talk about depending on where the person is on our Relationship Ruler. So, what did we learn? The Relationship Ruler can help us figure out how to act, and what to talk about with different people. We can talk about private details and problems with the people who are closest to us on this side of the ruler. With friends and acquaintances on this side of the ruler, we should talk about more general things like school or what’s happening that day. The Relationship Ruler helps us think about what to share with others, based on how close we are to them.

In this video, we're going to decide if people should Think It or Say It. Something you should only think is something that could hurt someone else or might be better left unsaid. You should keep those thoughts in your head and don't say them out loud. Before we speak, we can think about if it's kind or helpful. If your thought is something that won't hurt or offend anyone, we can say it. Every time we see this icon in the corner, we should stop and discuss what happened. Think about how everyone feels and why. Let's get started. In this video, Rachel thinks that her teacher made a mistake. Teacher: Okay, guys. Now that we're finished with our review, our unit quiz will be on Thursday. Rachel: Excuse me. I thought you said the quiz was Tuesday. The teacher said one thing and Rachel said something different. Is that something that Rachel should think or say? That's something that Rachel can say. Rachel thought that her teacher had made a mistake. She used indirect language to correct her. She asked a question rather than directly saying ""That's a mistake."" This way, Rachel was able to make a correction in a respectful way. Therefore, it's okay that she said it. Rachel: Excuse me. I thought you said the quiz was Tuesday. If Rachel called out that the teacher was wrong, that would have been something she should keep in her head. But by asking respectfully, Rachel was able to get her message across without upsetting anyone. Nice job, Rachel! Zach has been having a rough week. Let's see what happens when he tells Leah about it. Leah: Hey, Zach! Do you know what the Math homework is? Zach: No. Leah: What's wrong? Zach: I have so much work to do. And on top of that, I think my mom's going to lose her job. Leah: Oh, gosh! I'm so sorry to hear that. Zach: Yeah. I'm really worried about it. Leah: I'm sorry. That's hard. Zach told Leah a lot about his personal life there. Was that something he should think or say? That's something Zach should think. It's okay to share our feelings if something in our personal life is upsetting us, but we should think about who to talk to. If we share too many personal details with people we don't know very well, we can make them feel uncomfortable. Zach: And on top of that, I think my mom's going to lose her job. Leah: Oh, gosh! I'm so sorry to hear that. Zach should have waited to share these feelings with a close friend, a family member, or an adult he trusts. That way he can talk about the situation and his feelings without making others uncomfortable. In this video, we'll focus on Rachel and Leah as they talk about the school concert. Rachel: I saw you at the chorus concert! Leah: Yeah. My brother's in the 7th Grade Chorus so my family went. Rachel: Did you see my solo? I was so nervous. Do you think it went okay? Leah: It seemed like you forgot some of the words. Rachel: Oh... I was hoping no one noticed. Leah: Yeah, I did. Was that something Leah should think or say? That's something Leah should only think. When someone asks you how they did on something, they're usually looking for encouragement. If they said they were nervous, that means it was important for them to do well. Rachel: Did you see my solo? I was so nervous. Do you think it went okay? In this situation, it's better to focus on the positive things that the person did. We don't have to lie, but if we mention what we liked about it and leave out the things we didn't like, we won't hurt anyone's feelings. Difference between being honest and being too honest. This time, we'll focus on Justin when Zach asks him to hang out after school. Zach: Hey, do you want to come over on Saturday? We just got the newest PlayStation and I just got a ton of new games. Justin: I'd love to, but I can't on Saturday. Zach: Oh man! Justin: Maybe another time. What do you think? Was that something Justin should think or say? That's something Justin can say. Even though he said no to Zach's invitation, he did it politely. He told him that he can't make it this Saturday. Justin: I'd love to, but I can't on Saturday. Zach: Oh man! Justin: Maybe another time. Justin made sure to say no in a polite way. He also said ""maybe another time."" That made Zach feel a little better and let him know that Justin could still hang out with him at some point. This is a much gentler way that won't hurt people's feelings. If Justin had said what was in his head, that would have made Zach feel really bad. Have you ever had to say no to an invitation from someone? What did you say to make sure no one's feelings were hurt? In this video, Justin and Rachel are having a conversation when Leah wants to join in. Let's see how this goes. Justin: I can't wait for summer vacation! Rachel: I know! I'm going to Maine with my family. Justin: That sounds fun. I used to go to New Hampshire every summer with my family. Rachel: That's cool. I've been there a couple of times. Leah: I'm going to Florida this summer. Justin: I love Florida! I went last year. Leah: Where did you go? Justin: Orlando. Leah: Awesome! I'm going closer to Miami. Rachel: I'm jealous! Leah joined in Justin and Rachel's conversation by telling them about her trip to Florida. Is that something she should think or say? That's something that Leah can say. Even though she wasn't involved in the beginning of the conversation, Leah waited for a good time to join the conversation and made an on topic comment about her summer vacation plans. In this case, the timing was right for Leah to make a comment. If she had interrupted Justin or Rachel, or talked about a topic completely different from summer vacation, the conversation might not have gone smoothly. Do you ever find it hard to join in a conversation? What things could you look and listen for to help you figure out when to join in? Justin and Zach are discussing their Math homework. Let's focus on what Justin has to say about it. Zach: Ugh! These formulas are so hard! Justin: I did mine in two seconds. Zach: Well, it's taking me forever! Justin: I was able to get the back page done too. Zach: Good for you! Justin: Math is so easy for me. I'm thinking about moving up a level. Zach: Well, it's not that easy for everyone. Justin didn't have too much trouble with the Math homework there. Is that something he should think or say to Zach? That's something Justin should think. When someone else is struggling with something, they usually don't want to hear about how easy it is for you. Justin knew Zach was having trouble, but he kept saying how easy the work was and bragging about how good he was at Math. Justin: Math is so easy for me. I'm thinking about moving up a level. His bragging made Zach feel annoyed. Zach: Well, it's not that easy for everyone. Bragging can upset and annoy other people because it shows that you think you're better than them or you're just not thinking about them at all. In this situation, Justin should have stopped talking about himself and could have offered to help Zach with his work. That would make them both feel good. Great job, everyone! We saw lots of examples of things we should and shouldn't say. Some things we should only think are: Oversharing with someone we aren't close with and telling them too many personal details. Zach: I have so much work to do. And on top of that, I think my mom's going to lose her job. Leah: Oh, gosh! I'm so sorry to hear that. Telling someone they didn't do a good job. Rachel: Did you see my solo? I was so nervous. Do you think it went okay? Leah: It seemed like you forgot some of the words. And bragging about how good you are when someone else is having a hard time. Justin: Math is so easy for me. I'm thinking about moving up a level. Zach: Well, it's not that easy for everyone. Some things we can say are: Correcting others in a respectful way using indirect language. Rachel: Excuse me. I thought you said the quiz was Tuesday. Telling someone you can't hang out in a gentle way that won't hurt feelings. Justin: I'd love to, but I can't on Saturday. Zach: Oh man! Justin: Maybe another time. And making an on topic comment when joining in a conversation, Leah: I'm going to Florida this summer. Justin: I love Florida! I went last year. Leah: Where did you go? Justin: Orlando. Leah: Awesome! I'm going closer to Miami. Rachel: I'm jealous! The words we use have the power to impact how others feel and think. If our words will hurt someone or cause a problem, we should keep them in our head. If we think before we talk, we can make sure it's okay to say what we were thinking. Remember to think about if your words are helpful or kind. See you next time! "," - Welcome to Two Sides, a game where we compare the two sides of one behavior. In this video, we're going to decide if people should Think It or Say It. Something you should only think is something that could hurt someone else or might be better left unsaid. You should keep those thoughts in your head and don't say them out loud. Before we speak, we can think about if it's kind or helpful. If your thought is something that won't hurt or offend anyone, we can say it. Every time we see this icon in the corner, we should stop and discuss what happened. Think about how everyone feels and why. Let's get started. In this video, Rachel thinks that her teacher made a mistake. Teacher: Okay, guys. Now that we're finished with our review, our unit quiz will be on Thursday. Rachel: Excuse me. I thought you said the quiz was Tuesday. The teacher said one thing and Rachel said something different. Is that something that Rachel should think or say? That's something that Rachel can say. Rachel thought that her teacher had made a mistake. She used indirect language to correct her. She asked a question rather than directly saying ""That's a mistake."" This way, Rachel was able to make a correction in a respectful way. Therefore, it's okay that she said it. Rachel: Excuse me. I thought you said the quiz was Tuesday. If Rachel called out that the teacher was wrong, that would have been something she should keep in her head. But by asking respectfully, Rachel was able to get her message across wi",0.04686424987

In this video, we’ll play a fun game where we try to figure out which conversation drivers and conversation stoppers people are using! A conversation driver is a strategy you can use to start a conversation or keep it moving in the right direction. A conversation stopper stops a conversation before it’s ready to end! We want to try to use conversation drivers, and not use conversation stoppers. After we figure it out, we’ll mark the driver or stopper on our bingo board. If you get four drivers or stoppers in a row - up, down, across, or diagonal - you can say “bingo!” The first person to get bingo is the winner! Whenever we see this icon in the corner, we can stop and talk about how everyone is feeling. Let’s get started! Let’s focus on Jeff. What happens when Kate starts talking about her horseback riding lessons? Jeff: What are you doing this weekend? Kate: I have a horseback riding lesson. I just started. It's so much fun! Jeff: Oh. Kate: I hope I start doing competition soon. That will be awesome. Jeff: Yeah. Kate: Oh... well, talk to you later. Kate left that conversation. What happened there? Jeff stopped the conversation by... Not Acting Interested. Jeff was engaged in the conversation, then Kate started talking about her horseback riding lessons. When she did that, Jeff didn’t want to listen anymore, so he went back to playing on the iPad. Kate: I have a horseback riding lesson. I just started. It's so much fun! Jeff: Oh. Kate tried to continue the conversation, but Jeff still acted like he didn’t care. Kate: That will be awesome. Jeff: Yeah. Even when people are talking about things that aren’t very interesting to us, we still need to act interested. We want to encourage our friends. If we only talk about things we’re interested in, it’s hard for other people to have conversations with us. Find “Not Acting Interested” on your board, and mark it! For this video, let’s focus on Serena. Alessandra: Check out this bracelet my mom got me. Serena: Wow! That's really pretty! Alessandra: She got it for me on her trip to Arizona. Serena: The pattern looks really cool. Alessandra: I love the color. Serena: Yeah, me too. When Alessandra showed Serena her bracelet, Serena helped drive the conversation. How did she do it? Serena drove the conversation by... Making Comments. This helped them have a conversation. Making comments is a great way to start a conversation... Serena: Wow! That's really pretty. And make our friends have good thoughts about us. Find “Making Comments” on your board, and mark it! Let’s focus on Mike. Mike: Are you going to the football game this weekend? Kate: Yeah. It's going to be a really big game. Mike: Hmm... we're still talking about the football game. What can I say that has to do with the game? I know both teams have the best records in the league. Kate: I bet the whole school will be there. Mike: Should be fun. Mike took a second to think about what to say next. What conversation driver did he use? Mike drove the conversation by... Making Connected Comments. Connecting comments means we connect what we’re saying back to what the other person is saying. Kate made a comment about the football game, so Mike made a comment about the football game too. If we don’t connect our comments, people might become confused and the conversation can stall. Mike did a great job driving the conversation in the right direction. Find “Connecting Comments” on your board, and mark it! In this video, we’ll focus on Johnny. What does he have to say about his trip to Florida? Johnny: Hey Owen, I'm going to Florida this weekend. Owen: Cool! I went to... Johnny: I'm going to be going to Disney World and go on all the rides. Owen: Yeah, sounds fun. Johnny: The Tower of Terror is the best ride there. You go up, up, up and then down! Owen looked frustrated. What happened? Johnny stopped the conversation by... Not Taking Turns. Johnny was talking about his favorite rides, and Owen had things to say. But when he tried to talk, Johnny kept interrupting. Johnny: I'm going to be going to Disney World and go on all the rides. Owen: Yeah, it sounds fun. Johnny: The Tower of Terror is the best ride there. You go up, up, up and then down! A conversation is like a game of catch. One person takes a turn talking, and then they pass to the other person. If we don’t take turns, people might get frustrated. Find “Not Taking Turns in Conversation” on your board, and mark it! Let’s focus on Bobby. How does he answer Liz’s questions about the weekend? Liz: Hey, Bobby! Bobby: Hi, Liz! Liz: How was your weekend? Bobby: I don't know. Liz: Well, what did you do? Bobby: I don't know. Liz: Oh... okay. That conversation never really got started. How do you think it was stopped? Bobby stopped the conversation by... Not focusing on what Liz was asking. Liz asked Bobby a question, and he said “I don’t know.” Liz: Well, what did you do? Bobby: I don't know. Liz didn’t have anywhere else to go with the conversation and didn’t know what to say. Liz: Oh... okay. She may have even thought Bobby didn’t want to talk to her. If Bobby can take a little time to think about what Liz was asking, he might be able to give Liz an answer, and start the conversation moving. Find “Not Focusing” on your board, and mark it! Alessandra and Tyler are talking about weekend plans. Alessandra: Hey, Tyler. Tyler: Hey, Alessandra. How was your weekend? Alessandra: It was so fun. We went to a food truck festival. Tyler: What's that? I've never heard of it. Alessandra: They have all these restaurants inside these big trucks. They're all parked downtown. Tyler: What kind of foods were there? Alessandra: There were sandwiches, some had pizza. Tyler: What was your favorite food? Alessandra: I definitely like the taco truck best. It was so good. Tyelr: That sounds awesome. That was a nice conversation. How did Tyler drive the conversation? Tyler drove the conversation by... Asking Questions. Tyler had never heard of a food truck festival before. If he just said nothing because he didn’t know what to say, that would have stopped the conversation. By asking questions, he was able to keep the conversation going. Tyler: What's that? I've never heard of it. He was also able to learn more about what Alessandra likes. Tyler: What was your favorite food? Alessandra: I definitely like the taco truck best. It was so good! Tyler: That sounds awesome! He might be able to use that for future conversations. Find “Asking Questions” on your board, and mark it! For this video, let’s focus on Mike. Jeff: Guess what? I just signed up for a summer camp where we sleep in tents in the mountains for two weeks. Doesn't that sound exciting? Mike: I wouldn't want to go to that camp, but... Jeff is really excited. I don't want to hurt his feelings. It isn't exactly the truth, but I'll tell him it sounds fun. Yeah, man. That sounds awesome! Jeff: It's by a lake, so we can swim and fish there too. I can't wait! Mike: Cool! Mike wasn’t interested in what Jeff was doing. How did he drive the conversation? Mike drove the conversation by... Using a Filter. Mike didn’t say that he didn’t like camping. He wanted to encourage Jeff, so he talked about it anyway. Sometimes, we have thoughts that might hurt another person. If we say these things out loud, we might make our friends upset. By not saying these thoughts out loud, we can encourage our friends to continue talking. Everyone has different opinions and things they like. We won’t always like the same things as everybody else, but we should still be respectful. Find “Using a Filter” on your board, and mark it! Let’s focus on Devin. What happens when he comes over to talk to Serena? Devin: Hey, Serena! Serena: Hey, Devin! So... were you going to the basketball game this weekend? Devin: No. Are you? Serena: I'm on the team. I told you! Devin: Oh, yeah! Devin and Serena didn’t have much to talk about. How was the conversation stopped? Devin stopped the conversation by... Not Thinking About What to Talk About. Devin came over and didn’t have anything to say. Devin: Hey, Serena! Serena: Hey, Devin! When Serena started talking about the basketball game, Devin didn’t think about Serena. He forgot that she was on the basketball team. Serena: I'm on the team. I told you! Devin: Oh, yeah! When he wants to talk to people, Devin should have some topics to talk about. He could make small talk about the weekend, or he could think about what Serena likes, and talk to her about that. If he remembered that she’s on the basketball team, he could have asked her questions about basketball. Find “Not Thinking About What To Talk About” on your board, and mark it! In this video, Serena starts the conversation. How does she do it? Serena: Wow, I love your braid! Kate: Thank you. I love doing different types of braids. Serena: I bet it takes a lot of practice. Kate: You can learn too. It's not very hard. What conversation driver did Serena use? Serena drove the conversation by... Giving a Compliment. Serena noticed something she liked about her friend Kate and gave Kate a compliment. Compliments make other people feel good and have good thoughts about you. Kate was happy to talk about her braids because it’s something she’s interested in. Kate: Thank you! I love doing different types of braids. When Kate was talking about her braid, she had a big smile on her face. Find “Giving Compliments” on your board, and mark it! In this video, we’ll focus on Jeff. What happens when he starts talking about pizza? Kate: Want to hear something funny? Last night, my brother ate six slices of pizza all by himself. He felt so sick after. Sarah: Oh no! That's way too much pizza. Jeff: I can eat a whole pizza. That's eight pieces. Kate: I don't think I could. Jeff: I could run a whole mile afterwards. Sarah: Mm-hmm. Jeff: I could run so fast, I bet I could set a school record. Kate: Wow! Kate and Sarah looked uncomfortable when that conversation ended. What happened? Jeff stopped the conversation by... Only talking about himself. Jeff kept bringing the conversation back to himself and everything he can do. Jeff: I could run so fast, I bet I could set a school record. Kate: Wow! Kate and Sarah were tired of talking about Jeff, so they stopped talking. It can be hard to not talk about ourselves all the time. Everyone likes to talk about things they like and things they are good at. But other people don’t like to talk about one person all the time. It’s okay to talk about ourselves a little, but we should make sure to also talk about other people and things they like too. Find “Only Talking About You” on your board, and mark it! Great job, everyone! We learned a lot about conversation drivers and stoppers today! Conversation drivers start a conversation or keep it going. Some examples are: Making Comments... Serena: Wow! That’s really pretty! And Asking Questions. Tyler: What’s that? I’ve never heard of it. Conversation stoppers stop the conversation before it’s naturally ready to end. Some examples are: Not focusing on what people are asking... Liz: Well... what did you do? Bobby: I don't know. And not thinking about other people during a conversation. Serena: I’m on the team! I told you! Devin: Oh, yeah. Remember to try and use conversation drivers to keep your conversations moving! See you next time! "," - Welcome to Conversation Drivers and Stoppers bingo!

S,Being Rigid,N-S070,https://slp.everydayspeech.com/video/being-rigid,1-2,1,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,May-21,,"Having an Open Mind helps us accept others' ideas and opinions. We can recognize our Closed Mindset and switch to an Open Mindset by using calming strategies, positive thinking, and reframing our focus of control. To do this well, we determine what we can and can't control, and focus on what we can control. ",Keeping an Open Mind,,,,,,https://res.cloudinary.com/everyday-speech/raw/upload/v1619619053/SubtitlesVTT/N-S070_Being_Rigid.vtt," Being rigid is the opposite of being flexible. Instead of keeping an Open Mind, we have a Closed Mind. A Closed Mind is when we won’t accept changes or listen to other people’s ideas. When something happens that is different than we wanted, it can feel like a big problem. Our brains want to keep a Closed Mind. If we stay rigid and keep a Closed Mind, we will always feel upset or worried by change or new ideas. That’s why we try our best to keep an Open Mind. An Open Mind helps us be flexible and better prepared for change. To help us change from a Closed Mind to an Open Mind, we first need to stay calm. We choose a calming strategy or try to see the situation in a positive way. Using Positive Thinking can help us if we feel stuck. We tell ourselves, “I can do this” or “I’ll try something new.” Remember, sometimes the rules of a game change or unexpected things happen. We can’t always be in control of everything that happens to us. That’s why we practice having an Open Mind, so it’s easier to accept change and let new ideas in!

What do you guys think? Bobby: Yeah, I don’t want to see a scary movie anyways. A funny movie would be more fun. Chris: But we planned to see a scary movie. I’ve been thinking about it all week. Alessandra: We can just see another one. It’s not a big deal. Chris: But it is a big deal. I’m not going anymore! What went wrong there? Chris was being rigid and had a Closed Mind. He felt really upset when the plans changed. Let's see how that made his friends feel. Alessandra: Why did Chris get so upset? It's only a movie. Friends shouldn’t yell at each other. We can talk about this. Bobby: I don't like it when he yells at us. It makes me feel bad. Chris’ friends felt confused and annoyed by his reaction. They didn’t understand why he wasn’t being flexible or why he felt so upset when the plans changed. Let’s watch Chris try again. Alessandra: I know we said we'd see a scary movie, but I'm in the mood for a funny one. What do you guys think? Bobby: Yeah, I don’t really want to see a scary movie anyways. A funny movie would be more fun. Chris: This isn’t a big problem. How can I solve it? I can ask them to see it another time. How about this we’ll see the movie you guys want today, and then another day, we can see my movie. Bobby: Yeah, we can do that. Alessandra: I promise we’ll see the one you want. I’m just not in the mood today. Chris: Okay, cool. That time, Chris kept an Open Mind. Instead of getting upset when the plans changed, he was able to stay calm. This helped Chris be flexible.

We use a real measuring cup to help us figure out the right amount of ingredients to add when cooking. Sometimes we add a little, sometimes we add a lot, depending on the recipe. Conversations are like recipes. When someone asks “What’s up?” it’s usually a clue to keep your turn short and respond with something like, “Not much. How about you?” This barely fills our Conversation Measuring Cup, but it is just right for the situation. If people ask you a specific or more detailed question like, “What did you do this weekend?” that’s a clue they’re interested in talking for a longer time.

When you are asked a specific question you can fill up your cup and talk longer on your turn. Let’s see what using the Conversation Measuring Cup looks like. Kiara: Hey, Eric! Did you hear?

We use humor to connect with others, lighten serious moods, or just to make others laugh and feel good. We all use humor in different ways and there are lots of different types of humor. Our humor is one of the things that makes us unique. Using humor in the right way can be tricky, but here are some Do’s and Don’ts to help you out. First, think about Time & Place. Is it the right time and place for a joke? Think about where you are and what’s happening right now. The lunch table may be a better place for a joke than the classroom, but it all depends on that moment. We don’t want to mismatch the time and place. Telling a joke while others are trying to work is a don’t. We do want to Read the Room to consider people’s mood. Are they in the mood to hear something funny? Observe everyone’s facial expression, body language, and tone of voice. Then, you’ll know if it’s okay to joke around. Don’t try to be funny if people are in a serious mood. They probably won’t think you’re being funny, even if you are. Lastly, DO use the Relationship Ruler. This helps us measure the kind of relationship we have with each other. Some people are our close friends, while others are just acquaintances. Certain jokes or types of humor are only for close friends because others wouldn’t think it’s as funny. Always think about the person you’re talking to and what they’d think is funny. DON’T use the same kind of humor for close friends with people you don’t know that well. This can be confusing or awkward because you don’t know their sense of humor that well. It’s fun to use humor and make others laugh. For others to think a joke is funny, it depends largely on the time and place, their mood, and the relationship you have with those people. Don’t get discouraged if people don’t always think you’re funny, just try to figure out why. We all develop humor throughout our lives by paying attention to what’s funny and what’s not, and learning from our mistakes. We always think before we use humor. Think about Time and Place. Is it the right time or situation for a joke? Read the Room to know if people are in the right mood for joking around.

You're expected to get along and work together to get something done. It can be hard if you don't agree with someone you’re working with.

We make sure to listen to others and ask their opinion so we all can agree. When it’s our turn to share, we do our best to explain ourselves so others understand us. We stay friendly by using encouraging words. We do our share of the work. Everyone notices how much work each person is doing and tallies up in their mind if it is fair.

They don't want to work with her if she acts selfishly. How do you think Alessandra feels? Let’s see what she’s thinking. Alessandra: Spain’s my favorite country. Why can't we just do what I want? Alessandra also feels upset. She needs to remember that when we work with groups, we have to compromise. Everyone can't get their way every time.

If everyone wants to do France, I guess it's okay. That time, Alessandra worked well with the group.

There are certain times when it’s better to use indirect language because people will be more likely to do what you ask if you say it gently, or indirectly. Here are a few tips to learn to speak in an indirect way. Using these tips, you may find people agree with you more than in the past. Use a question instead of a direction Ease into conversations slowly by making polite comments to show you are thinking about the other person, then ask for what you want. Adding a few new words can make a big difference. Using words like ‘maybe' or 'could' sounds more gentle than words that sound demanding like 'should' 'must' or 'have to.' Think about these two sentences that are asking for the same thing. “We have to make blueberry muffins,” and “it’d be fun to make blueberry muffins.” More people would say yes to the indirect comment because it sounds kinder. We often use indirect language to disagree kindly. We don’t always have to agree with others, but we don’t want to make someone upset when we disagree. Rather than say, “You’re wrong,” you might say, “I see what you’re saying, but I think….” People won’t always agree with us, but they might agree with us more often if we learn to use indirect language. To have better chances of getting others to agree with us, we can use Indirect language instead of Direct. Have a short conversation before you ask for what you want. Replace 'should' or 'must' with softer words like 'could' or 'maybe' Make your request a question that gives a person a choice Say, ""do you think we should... ?"" or “how would you feel if we… ?” Learning to speak indirectly takes some practice, but you’ll be able to convince people to see things your way more often. Let’s see what happens when we try to get what we want using direct and indirect language. Anika: What do you think? I put this image into our presentation. Niko: Hmm... that doesn’t look good. Anika: Okay then. Niko: Our conclusion isn't done. You should go do that. Anika: Okay, I guess I'll work on it. What happened there? Niko used direct language to give Anika his opinion and tell her what he wanted her to do. Anika said she would work on the conclusion but how do you think she really felt? What do you think she was thinking? Anika: Niko was so rude. I don't want to work with him again. Niko: I have really good ideas, so I want people to listen to me. It's great to want to share your ideas but think about the best way to say them. Niko offended Anika that time. Let’s watch him use indirect language and see if it helps him. Anika: What do you think? I put this image into our presentation. Niko: I need to make my language gentle and indirect if I want everything to go well. It’s not bad, I just don't love the cartoon. Do you want to try a photograph? Anika: Yeah, sure. I saw one a second ago. I’ll find it. Niko: I need Anika to write the conclusion because I don’t have time. I’ll use “Is it possible” as a way of making my request softer. I won’t ask right away. I‘ll make a little conversation first. So what do you like better, reading or projects like this? Anika: I like them about the same. Niko: Oh and one more thing the introduction is taking me a little while to do. Is it possible that you could do the conclusion for me? Anika: Yeah, sure. Niko: Thanks. Anika: No problem. How did Niko work with Anika differently this time? Let’s see what Niko and Anika are thinking about each other now. Anika: Niko was a good partner to work with. He asked for my help nicely so I didn’t mind doing the work. Niko: Using indirect language really helps! I don’t feel like I’m arguing anymore and Anika doesn’t seem upset. That time, Niko used Indirect Language to offer his opinion and ask for what he wanted. He used words like “Is it possible...?"" and ""maybe let’s do this..."" instead of saying, ""We have to do this.""

SEL,Being Empathetic,SEL10,https://slp.everydayspeech.com/video/being-empathetic,2-3,2-3,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,Aug-20,,TEACHER SCRIPT: Today we are discussing how to be empathetic. Who can define what ‘empathy’ is and why we would want to be more empathetic?,Empathy Essentials,,,,,,https://res.cloudinary.com/everyday-speech/raw/upload/v1619186995/SubtitlesVTT/SEL10_Being_Empathetic.vtt," Empathy is the ability to understand how someone else feels, then show you care about those feelings through your words and actions. Empathy creates bonds with people and strengthens relationships. Without empathy, we can’t have close friendships; because we might make the wrong decisions or hurt someone's feelings. Research now shows we can grow our empathy by making it a part of our daily lives. If we are struggling with friendships, we can try strengthening our own empathy to become a better friend. Here are some ways we can grow our empathy. Wonder About Others. Start a conversation with someone new. Ask questions so you can learn about people who aren’t in your regular circle of friends. They can be very different from you. You may not end up friends. The point is more to learn interesting things about others’ lives. Find commonalities with people who are different from you. Put away stereotypes you may have about others who look different than you. Find at least one common trait you two share, like values, a sense of humor, and hobbies. Talk to others in two new ways. Listen closely to what the person is saying and how they might be feeling. Share about your own life. Empathy requires both people sharing about themselves, not just one person. Invite Invitations are one of the best ways to be empathetic to others’ needs. It’s the small invitations that are often the most important. Start to see invitations in small, everyday moments. You invite someone every time you: Offer someone a seat. Allow others to join a conversation. Ask for their opinion. Walk together somewhere. Make small talk. Greet someone. Share a story. All of these things show you think about others and care that they feel included. Teachers, you can pause here to discuss this list with your students, give examples, and check for understanding. DISCUSSION: To grow your empathy: Think of someone you see most days, but never talk to What questions could you ask to help you both find common interests? Remember, you’re not aiming for becoming best friends, you’re trying to learn from them. What story can you share about your life? Who needs an invitation to feel included in a small daily moment? Include them today or tomorrow. "," Empathy is the ability to understand how someone else feels, then show you care about those feelings through your words and actions.

Where is she? 35 Zari: The substitute teacher says she's out sick. 36 Mrs. T: Five more minutes. Then we line up to wash hands 37 and go to lunch. 38 Isaiah: Oh, we don't do it that way. 39 Zari: She forgot to ring the bell 40 and that line will take forever. 41 Hmm, what happened there? 42 Did Isaiah and Zari handle the classroom changes? 43 What do you think, everybody? 44 Give",0.1815771114

I’m not ready! This is so unfair! Did Julian stay calm? No, he didn’t. Let’s see how everyone was feeling. Julian: I completely forgot about this quiz. Teacher: I’m really disappointed that Julian couldn’t control his reactions or stay calm. That wasn’t very mature behavior. Kiara: Julian’s so upset over something that wasn’t that big of a deal. Why does he flip out like that? Julian’s teacher was disappointed in his behavior and he made his classmate, Kiara, feel uncomfortable when he lost control.

I didn’t make my teacher or class feel uncomfortable and I didn’t need help calming down. Teacher: Julian was able to stay calm even though he looked upset at first. I’m really proud of him.

SEL,Setting Goals EE,SEL21,https://slp.everydayspeech.com/video/setting-goals-ee,1-2,2,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,Aug-20,,"TEACHER SCRIPT: Today we’re talking about setting goals. Before watching, ask your group the difference between a wish and a goal.",Solving a Problem,,,,,,https://res.cloudinary.com/everyday-speech/raw/upload/v1619186996/SubtitlesVTT/SEL21_Setting_Goals.vtt," Today, we’re talking about setting goals. A goal is something that we want to do, and we work hard to get better at it. A goal is different from a wish. A goal is not something you wish you had, like a bike or toy. A goal is something you want to improve about your life and you practice it. We can have goals for school, home, or activities. Some examples of school goals are: to read more books, to try something myself before asking for help, and to keep my desk clean. Some examples of home goals are: make my own lunch, be patient with my brother, or to play outside more. Some examples of activity goals are to practice the drums, to get better at drawing, or to score a goal in soccer this season. Let’s pause here and think of some of our own goals for school, home and our activities. Write a goal for each one. What do you want to accomplish? We want our goal to be specific. This helps us know exactly what we should work on. What exactly do we want to get better at? Instead of saying “I hope I get better at art,” stop and think of what will help you improve, like watching videos of other artists, asking the art teacher for help, or spending 15 minutes a day after school practicing. Let’s look at these general goals and practice making them more specific. ‘I will improve my writing’ and ‘I will get along with my sister.’ Pause here and discuss how to make these two goals more specific. We want our goals to be possible. This means you can really accomplish them with some work. If we set a goal that is too hard, we will probably give up on it. We want it to be a “just right” goal. This means it’s not too easy or too hard. Try to pick small steps you can do in a month. Let’s go back to your list of goals. How can we make these a “just right” goal in one month? What are some steps you can take to reach the goal? Pause to discuss ideas. It helps to choose a goal that’s important to you. If we’d forget about it in a few days, it's probably not a goal that’s important to us. Pause to look at your list and decide if your goals are very important to you. Set a date. We will try to accomplish our goal by this day. Two weeks or one month is a good amount of time to work on your goal. Pause to add a date for your goals. Remember, setting goals means you will practice your new skill or mindset. When we take the time to set a goal and achieve it, we will feel proud! GROUP DISCUSSION: How is a goal different from a wish? Why is setting a goal important? Pick one of your goals to start working on this week. Discuss with the group if possible.

In this video, we’re going to decide if people should Think It or Say It. Something you should only think is something that could hurt someone else, or might be better left unsaid. This can also be called Using A Filter. If we should think it, it doesn’t pass the filter from our thoughts to our words. Something you should say is something that is positive or won’t offend or hurt anyone. Every time we see this icon in the corner, we should stop and discuss what happened. How does everyone feel? Why? Let’s get started! Serena and Alessandra are working on drawings. Let’s focus on what Serena says. Serena: Let me see your drawing! Alessandra: Here it is! Serena: Wow, that looks awesome! It looks really great! Alessandra: Thanks. I like yours too. I love the details you put in. Serena: Thanks! Is that something Serena should think or say? That’s something Serena should... Say. Compliments are something we want to say to friends. Compliments are a nice way to make someone have good thoughts about you. If someone shows us something they are working on, it’s polite to give them a compliment or make a nice comment about it. Alessandra comes up to Serena and asks a question. Let’s watch what happens. Alessandra: Hey, do you know what the Math homework was? Serena: Yeah! I'm pretty sure it's all even questions from Chapter 3! Alessandra, I think you have something in your teeth. Alessandra: I'll be right back! That was embarrassing for Alessandra. Is that something Serena should think or say? That’s something Serena should... say. Even though it was embarrassing for Alessandra, Serena should tell Alessandra that. As her friend, she wants to help Alessandra. She doesn’t want Alessandra to walk around all day with something in her teeth. That would be even more embarrassing! Can you think of a time you had to tell someone something like what Serena told Alessandra? Jeff and Mike are talking about Jeff’s camping trip. Let’s see what Mike has to say about it. Jeff: Hey, guess what! I just signed up for a summer camp where we sleep in tents in the mountains for two weeks! Doesn't that sound like fun? Mike: I'm not really that into camping. Sleeping outside doesn't sound that fun to me. Jeff: Oh... I thought it sounded fun. What happened there? Mike doesn’t like camping. Is that something he should think or say? That’s something Mike should ... Think. Even though Mike was telling the truth, he didn’t notice how excited Jeff was about his trip. Jeff’s voice sounded excited. Jeff: Hey, guess what! I just signed up for a summer camp where we sleep in tents in the mountains for two weeks! Doesn't that sound like fun? And he had a big smile on his face. After Mike told him he didn’t think it was fun, Jeff’s smile disappeared and he turned his body away from Mike. Jeff: Oh... I thought it sounded fun. Sometimes, telling someone how we feel about something might hurt their feelings. If they are really excited about something we don’t like, we probably shouldn’t tell them that we don’t like it. Everyone is interested in different things. Have you ever not told someone something to spare their feelings? Tyler and Mike are discussing movies. Let’s focus on what Mike has to say. Tyler: Do you like Star Wars? Mike: Yeah, I've seen them all! Tyler: I think Return of the Jedi is the best one. What do you think? Mike: I don't think so. I think Empire Strikes Back is better. Chewbacca is my favorite! Tyler: Alright. I still think Return of the Jedi is better though. Let's agree to disagree. Mike didn’t agree with Tyler. Is that something Mike should think or say? That’s something Mike should... Say. Even though he disagreed with Tyler, it’s just an opinion. Tyler asked Mike for his opinion, so Mike gave it to him. Tyler: I think Return of the Jedi is the best one. What do you think? Mike: I don't think so. I think Empire Strikes Back is better. Chewbacca is my favorite! Mike was still respectful of Tyler’s opinion. As long as it won’t hurt someone’s feelings, we can share our opinions. They might be different than someone else’s and that’s okay. Tyler and Serena are talking. Mike overhears and has something to say. Let’s watch. Tyler: So, we got a new car this weekend. It's awesome! Serena: What kind is it? Mike: Um... did you get a new car or did your parents get a new car? Tyler: Well... it's my parents' actually. Anyway, we traded in our minivan for an SUV. Mike: Your parents got an SUV. Tyler: Yeah. Is that something Mike should think or say? That’s something Mike should... Think. Even though Mike was technically right when he was correcting Tyler, it wasn’t necessary. It didn’t matter that Tyler’s parents bought the car and not him. It doesn’t feel good to be corrected, especially in a situation that isn’t helping. When Mike kept correcting Tyler, he started to make Tyler and Serena feel annoyed. Next time, Mike could think... Is this important enough to say out loud? How will people feel if I say it? The group is sitting down at the desks when Tyler has something to say. Let’s see. Tyler: Um... hey! Would any of you mind switching seats with me? I can't really focus in the back. Serena: Sure! We can trade seats. Tyler: Thanks! Is that something Tyler should think or say? That’s something Tyler should... Say. When we advocate for ourselves, we make our needs known. Tyler was very respectful and gave his classmates a reason why he needed to move up. Tyler: Hey, would any of you mind switching seats with me? I can't really focus in the back. If there is something we need, we can ask politely for it. If we do it in a nice or respectful way, there’s nothing wrong with advocating for ourselves. Can you remember a time you needed something in class? Did you say something? If so, what did you say? Alessandra and Mike are having a conversation when Alessandra starts talking about her family. Let’s see what she has to say. Mike: Hey, Alessandra. What's up? Alessandra: Not much. My parents were talking last night about how my dad might lose his job. They say money is really tight now. Mike: Oh... um, okay. Is that something Alessandra should think or say? That’s something Alessandra should... Think. Sometimes we hear our parents say things that are better kept in private. When we tell other people private information, it can make them uncomfortable. Mike: Oh... um, okay. And we can upset our parents, because they probably don’t want other people to know private information. This is also called Oversharing. We are sharing information with people that they don’t need to know! Give two examples of things that should be kept private. Be sure not to give the private information, just some general ideas! Alessandra and Serena are having a conversation about Serena’s new house. Let’s see what Alessandra has to say. Alessandra: Hey! My mom told me you were moving. Where? Serena: Just a few streets down to Maple Street. Alessandra: Cool! Serena: Yeah, my house is blue and it has a pool in the backyard! Alessandra: Is it big? How big is it? Serena: Yeah, I guess it's big. Alessandra: You guys are probably rich, right? Serena: Um... How did Alessandra end the conversation? Is that something she should think or say? That’s something Alessandra should... Think. Alessandra was asking appropriate questions to start, but then she started talking about how much money the house cost. That comment crossed the line. Talking about money isn’t a subject we should discuss with friends. Talking about money in public can make other people uncomfortable. Alesandra: You guys are probably rich, right? Serena: Um... That’s a topic that’s better left to talk about in private. What are some other topics we shouldn’t discuss with friends? Great job, everyone! We learned a lot about using our filters today! Some things we should only think are: Correcting others when it’s not necessary. Tyler: Anyway, we traded in our minivan for an SUV. Mike: Your parents got an SUV. Tyler: Yeah. And private information from our parents. Alessandra: My parents were talking last night about how my dad might lose his job. They say money is really tight now. Some things we can say are: Our opinion on things... Mike: I don’t think so. I think Empire Strikes Back is better. Chewbacca is my favorite! And advocating for ourselves when we need something. Tyler: Hey, would any of you mind switching seats with me? I can’t really focus in the back. Using our filter and deciding if a thought is something you should only think or say, is an important step in having conversations! See you next time!

In this video, we’re going to try to figure out how people are going to react to different situations. After each video, we’ll give you three choices. You have to guess which one is going to happen. This video is all about Think It or Say It. Something you should only think is something that could hurt someone else. We keep these thoughts in our brain. Something you should say is something that can help other people or is okay to let out of your brain. This can also be called Using A Filter. If we should only think it, it doesn’t pass the filter from inside our brain to our lips saying it out loud. If it’s something we should only think, people might get upset if we decide to say it. Whenever we see this icon in the corner, we can stop and talk about the situation. Let’s get started! Let’s watch Andrew. He has something to ask the teacher. Andrew: Excuse me? Teacher: Yes, Andrew? Andrew: I need to pee really, really bad. How do you think the class will feel? Should Andrew have said that in class? The class will feel... Understanding of Andrew Silly because that is not something you say out loud Bored by Andrew’s comment Teacher: Andrew, come up to my desk please. That wasn’t something that Andrew should have said out loud. Part of using a filter is deciding if something is public or private. Something private is something that should stay in our head. Andrew could have quietly asked the teacher to go to the bathroom. He doesn’t need to give any more details than that. For this video, we’re going to focus on Liz when she doesn’t want to do a school assignment. Teacher: Okay, class, it's time to work on our Words of the Week. Liz: Words of the Week are so boring! I don't want to! Liz didn’t want to do her words of the week. Is that something she should think or say? What do you think the teacher will be thinking? The teacher will think... It’s no big deal Liz isn’t being appropriate in class Liz shouldn’t have to do the work Teacher: Liz, that's not appropriate for the classroom. Come up and see me please. The teacher thinks that Liz shouldn’t say things like that in class. There are going to be times in school where we have to do something we don’t want to do. But, we don’t want to disrupt the class. We should keep those thoughts in our head. Alessandra and Serena are having a conversation together. Let’s see what happens. Serena: Let me see your drawing! Alessandra: Here it is! Serena: Wow, that looks awesome! It looks really great! Alessandra will... Thank Serena Not say anything Start talking about lunch Alessandra: Thanks. I like yours too. I love the details you put in. Serena: Thanks! Alessandra said ""thank you"" to Serena and gave her a compliment back. Compliments are almost always something you can say out loud. It’s a great way to start conversations with friends or have them think good thoughts about us. Look around the room. Is there anyone you could give a compliment to? What could you say? Matt is in class when he gets assigned a partner for work. Let’s see what happens next. Teacher: Let's pair up to discuss chapter 4. Matt, you can work with Christine and Josh, you can work with Liz. Matt: But I don't want to work with Christine. I want to work with Josh! Teacher: Matt, you can work with Josh another time. You're working with Christine this time. Matt: Fine! What do you think Christine will be thinking? Christine will be... Upset because she thinks Matt doesn’t like her Upset because she wanted to work with Liz Upset because she didn’t want to do work at all Christine: That wasn't very nice. Why doesn't Matt want to work with me? I guess he doesn't like me. That wasn’t a nice thing of Matt to say. Even if he just likes working with Josh, it still made Christine feel bad. She got the impression that Matt doesn’t like her. If we’re going to say something that’s going to make someone feel bad, we should keep that thought in our head and not say it out loud. The group is in class. Alessandra has a joke to tell. Is it something she should think or say? Teacher: We're done a bit early so we can have 5 minutes of free time before lunch. Alessandra: Yes! Okay, I have a joke. So, there are two muffins in an oven. One of the muffins turns to the other one and says, ""Boy, it's hot in here."" The other one goes, ""Oh my god, a talking muffin!"" What do you think will happen next? The... Teacher will get upset with Alessandra Rest of the group will laugh Rest of the group will be annoyed with Alessandra That was something that Alessandra can say! It was an appropriate time to tell a joke. The teacher told the class they had free time, so she wasn’t interrupting. Teacher: We're done a bit early so we can have 5 minutes of free time before lunch. And the rest of the group was interested in Alessandra’s joke. They all leaned in to hear. Alessandra: Yes! Okay, I have a joke. So, there are two muffins in an oven. One of the muffins turns to the other one and says, ""Boy, it's hot in here."" The other one goes, ""Oh my god, a talking muffin!"" Telling a joke isn’t always something you should say. There’s a time and a place for a joke. Alessandra did a nice job picking the right time! What are two times it’s appropriate to tell a joke and two times it’s not? Mike and Tyler are having a conversation and Tyler tells Mike how he feels. Let’s see what happens. Mike: So, I know you wanted to go to the mall after school, but... I wanted to go to the skate park. So I told everyone we're doing that. Tyler: What? I was really looking forward to going to the mall. Mike: Well, I really wanted to go to the skate park. Tyler: That's not very nice! There are things that I plan on buying at the mall! Mike: I'm sorry. I didn't think you'd care. Tyler: Next time, I wish you would talk to me first. I don't like when you decide for the both of us. Tyler was firm with his friend. Was that something he should think or say? What will happen next? Mike will... Listen to Tyler Yell at Tyler Stop talking to Tyler Mike: Alright. I will. Mike listened to Tyler. Tyler didn’t like the way that Mike was treating him, and expressed his feelings. But he did it in a respectful way. Tyler: Next time, I wish you would talk to me first. I don’t like when you decide for the both of us. Mike: Alright. I will. Even though he was upset, he didn’t start yelling. Sometimes, we have to stand up for ourselves when we don’t feel like we’re being treated fairly. It’s okay to express our feelings. We should just try to keep our self control. Can you remember a time you had to stand up to a friend, relative, or classmate? Tyler and Mike are discussing movies. Let’s focus on what Mike has to say. Tyler: Do you like Star Wars? Mike: Yeah. I've seen them all. Tyler: I think Return of the Jedi is the best one. What do you think? Mike: No, I don't think so. I think Empire Strikes Back is better. Chewbacca is my favorite! Mike didn’t agree with Tyler. Is that something Mike should think or say? What will Tyler think? Tyler will think... Mike is wrong and he’s right Mike is right and he’s wrong No one is right or wrong Tyler: Hmm... Alright. I still like Return of the Jedi better though. Agree to disagree. Tyler understood it was just an opinion. We can say our opinions out loud, as long as we’re respectful of other’s opinions. Mike said his opinion in a respectful way. Mike: No, I don’t think so. I think Empire Strikes Back is better. Chewbacca is my favorite! When Tyler said “agree to disagree”... Tyler: Hmm... Alright. I still like Return of the Jedi better though. Agree to disagree. He meant that he still has a different opinion than Mike, but Mike is allowed to think differently. Can you remember a time when you had a different opinion than someone else? Alessandra and Mike are having a conversation when Alessandra starts talking about her family. Let’s see what she has to say. Mike: Hey Alessandra, what's up? Alessandra: Not much. My parents were talking last night about how my dad might lose his job. They say money is really tight now. Is that something Alessandra should Think or Say? How do you think Mike will feel? Mike will feel... Interested in hearing more. Uncomfortable. Bored because he doesn’t care. Mike: Oh... um, okay. Topics like money are private and should stay in our head. When we tell other people private information, it can make them uncomfortable. Mike: Oh... um, okay. Great job, everyone! We learned a lot about using our filter today! When we say Think It thoughts out loud, we might not get the reaction we expect. Some things we shouldn’t say out loud are: Private information, like things about our bodies Andrew: I need to pee really really bad! And things that can hurt other people Matt: But I don’t want to work with Christine! I want to work with Josh! Some things we can say are: Jokes at an appropriate time Alessandra: So, there are two muffins in an oven. One of the muffins turns to the other one and says, “Boy, it’s hot in here.” The other one goes, “Oh my god, a talking muffin!"" Our feelings when we don’t think we’re being treated fairly Tyler: Next time, I wish you would talk to me first. I don’t like when you decide for the both of us. Using our filter and deciding if a thought is something you should think or say, is an important step in having conversations. See you next time! "," - Welcome to Guess What Happens Next. In this video, we’re going to try to figure out how people are going to react to different situations. After each video, we’ll give you three choices. You have to guess which one is going to happen. This video is all about Think It or Say It. Something you should only think is something that could hurt someone else. We keep these thoughts in our brain. Something you should say is something that can help other people or is okay to let out of your brain. This can also be called Using A Filter. If we should only think it, it doesn’t pass the filter from inside our brain to our lips saying it out loud. If it’s something we should only think, people might get upset if we decide to say it. Whenever we see this icon in the corner, we can stop and talk about the situation. Let’s get started! Let’s watch Andrew. He has something to ask the teacher. Andrew: Excuse me? Teacher: Yes, Andrew? Andrew: I need to pee really, really bad. How do you think the class will feel? Should Andrew have said that in class? The class will feel... Understanding of Andrew Silly because that is not something you say out loud Bored by Andrew’s comment Teacher: Andrew, come up to my desk please. That wasn’t something that Andrew should have said out loud. Part of using a filter is deciding if something is public or private. Something private is something that should stay in our head.

Is the main character using a Conversation Driver or a Conversation Stopper? A conversation driver is something we use to start a conversation or drive it in the right direction. A conversation stopper ends a conversation before it is ready!

In this video, we’re going to compare Conversation Drivers and Conversation Stoppers. Conversation Drivers drive a conversation. That means they get a conversation going or keep it moving in the right direction. Conversation Stoppers stop the conversation before it’s ready to end. When we’re talking with people, we want to try to keep the conversation moving in the right direction. All conversations have to end some time, but we want to try to make sure they end naturally and not too early. Every time we see this icon in the corner, we should stop and discuss what happened. Did the conversation keep moving or did it stop? Why? Let’s get started! Serena and Alessandra are talking about a movie Alessandra watched. Let’s pay attention to Serena. Are her actions a Conversation Driver or Conversation Stopper? Alessandra: I watched a cool movie about penguins yesterday. Serena: Oh, cool! Alessandra: Yeah. They migrate to find food and have to protect their babies the whole time. Serena: Wow! I didn't know that. What do you think? Did Serena use a Conversation Driver or Conversation Stopper? Serena drove the conversation. One of the first conversation drivers in any conversation is Acting Like You’re Interested. How did Serena do that? She faced her body and eyes towards Alessandra. Her tone of voice sounded excited. Serena: Oh, cool! And she made connecting comments back. These are comments that are on topic. They show she was listening and interested in what Alessandra had to say. Serena: Wow! I didn't know that. These body language clues from Serena encouraged Alessandra to continue talking and move the conversation in the right direction. Mike and Sarah want to start a conversation. Do they keep it moving in the right direction, or does the conversation stop? Let’s see. Sarah: Hey, Mike! Mike: Hey, Sarah! Did you see the baseball game last night? Sarah: I did! What a good game! Mike: I can't believe they won after being down by so much. Sarah: I know, right? Was that a Conversation Driver or a Conversation Stopper? Mike and Sarah did a great job driving the conversation. Mike and Sarah got the conversation started with a greeting. Sarah: Hey, Mike! Mike: Hey, Sarah! Then, Mike made a comment about something that happened recently. Mike: Did you see the baseball game last night? Last, Mike and Sarah used a very important conversation driver - taking turns while talking. The conversation went back and forth. Each person took a turn to keep the conversation going. Mike: Did you see the baseball game last night? Sarah: I did! What a good game! Mike: I can't believe they won after being down by so much. Sarah: I know, right? What are three things people could discuss in everyday conversations or small talk? Alessandra and Chris are having a conversation. Let’s pay attention to Alessandra. Does she drive the conversation or stop it? Chris: My soccer team has a game this weekend. We’re playing the best team. Alessandra: What’s your favorite type of pizza? Mine’s cheese. Chris: Oh, yeah. Cheese is cool. As I was saying, the team is really good. Alessandra: The pizza place by my house makes the best pizza. It’s my favorite. Chris: Oh, that’s cool. Was that a Conversation Driver or a Conversation Stopper? Why? Alessandra didn’t connect what she was saying back to what Chris was saying. He was talking about soccer and she started talking about pizza! That stopped the conversation. Chris was talking about soccer when Alessandra kept talking about pizza. That made Chris feel confused and the conversation ended quickly. Chris: Oh, that's cool. Alessandra needs to connect her comments back to what Chris is saying. When he said something about his soccer game, she can say something about his soccer game back. That’s a perfect match like pieces in a puzzle. Liz comes up to Bobby and asks him a question. He isn’t sure what to say. Does he use a Conversation Driver or Conversation Stopper? Liz: Hey, Bobby! Bobby: Hi, Liz! Liz: How was your weekend? Bobby: I don't know. Liz: Well, what did you do? Bobby: Well, I hung out at my house a lot and played a lot of computer. What did you do? Liz: I went to my brother's soccer game. Bobby: Oh, cool! What do you think? Was that a Conversation Driver or a Conversation Stopper? The conversation almost ended when Bobby said “I don’t know” to Liz’s question, but when she asked again, he focused on what she was asking, took a second, and thought about what he did over the weekend. He was able to give Liz an answer and drive the conversation. When people ask us questions, we need to focus on what they are asking. If we don’t focus, it can be hard to give a good answer! Good answers will lead to more conversation and drive it along. Jeff, Kate, and Sarah are all sitting around chatting. Let’s see how the conversation goes. Kate: Want to hear something funny? Last night, my brother ate six slices of pizza all by himself. He felt so sick after. Sarah: Oh no! That's way too much pizza! Jeff: I can eat a whole pizza! That's eight pieces! Kate: I don't think I could. Jeff: I could run a whole mile afterwards. Sarah: Mm-hmm. Jeff: I could run so fast, I bet I could set a school record. Kate: Wow. Do you think that conversation ended naturally? Was the conversation moved along or stopped? By who? Jeff stopped that conversation by only talking about himself. He didn’t think about what everyone else was saying because he only cared about what he had to say. Jeff: I can eat a whole pizza! That's eight pieces. Kate: I don't think I could. Jeff: I could run a whole mile afterwards. Sarah: Mm-hmm. Jeff: I could run so fast, I bet I could set a school record. Kate: Wow. When we only talk about ourselves or things we are interested in, it’s difficult to keep the conversations going. It’s hard not to talk about ourselves, but other people might not always want to hear about us. If we include them in the conversation, it’s much easier to keep the conversation moving! There are some things that are important to us, but not important to other people, and some things that are important to other people that aren’t important to us. Give an example of each. Mike and Jeff are having a conversation when Jeff has some news to share. Let’s see how it goes. Jeff: Hey, guess what? I just signed up for a summer camp where we sleep in tents in the mountains for two weeks! Doesn’t that sound like fun? Mike: I’m not really that into camping. Sleeping outside doesn’t sound that fun to me. Jeff: Oh. I thought it sounded fun. What happened there? Did the conversation end at a natural place? Jeff started driving the conversation by talking about something that recently happened to him. But Mike stopped the conversation when he told Jeff that he didn’t think his camping trip sounded very fun. Even though Mike was telling the truth, he didn’t notice how excited Jeff was about his trip. Jeff’s voice sounded excited. Jeff: Hey, guess what? I just signed up for a summer camp where we sleep in tents in the mountains for two weeks! Doesn’t that sound like fun? And he had a big smile on his face. After Mike told him he didn’t think it was fun, Jeff’s smile disappeared and he turned his body away from Mike. Jeff: I thought it sounded fun. Mike could have used a White Lie. That means he isn’t telling the whole truth, but he doesn’t hurt Jeff’s feelings. If he encourages Jeff, Jeff will have good thoughts about him and want to keep the conversation going. Alessandra and Serena are working on their drawings when Serena decides to try and start a conversation. Let’s see how it goes. Serena: Let me see your drawing! Alessandra: Here it is. Serena: Wow, that looks awesome! It looks really great. Alessandra: Thanks! I like yours too. I love the details you put in. Alessandra: Thanks! That was a short conversation. Did Alessandra and Serena move it in the right direction or stop it? Even though the conversation was short, it ended naturally. Serena and Alessandra did a great job moving the conversation. Serena and Alessandra used a great conversation driver. They gave each other compliments. A compliment is a great way to start or continue a conversation. When Serena gave Alessandra a compliment, Alessandra said thank you and gave one back. Both Serena and Alessandra felt happy. What are some examples of things you can compliment classmates on? Lastly, let’s take a look at Kate and Sarah during their conversation. Kate: Hey, Sarah! Sarah: Hey, Kate! Kate: I like your notebook. Which Harry Potter book is your favorite? Sarah: I love Deathly Hallows but it's hard to pick just one. I like them all. Kate: Me too! Did Kate drive the conversation or stop it? How? Kate did a great job of driving the conversation there! How did she do it? She used her eyes to observe Sarah, and noticed she had decorated her notebook with a Harry Potter sticker. This is a great clue that Sarah would like to talk about Harry Potter. Because Kate observed Sarah, she had a conversation driver ready to go! These clues could be on a person’s clothes, their notebooks or backpacks, or maybe it’s something you remember them talking about in the past. Look around the room. Can you spot any clues that could give you a hint about what to talk about with someone? If not, try to remember some interest other people have. Great job sorting our conversation drivers and conversation stoppers! Remember, Conversation Drivers start conversations or keep them going in the right direction. Conversation Stoppers stop conversations before they are ready to end. Some examples of Conversation Drivers are showing interest in what the other person is saying... Serena: Oh, cool! And taking turns in conversation. Mike: Did you see the baseball game last night? Sarah: I did! What a good game! Some examples of conversation stoppers are not connecting your comments back to what the other person is saying... Chris: My soccer team has a game this weekend. We're playing the best team. Alessandra: What's your favorite type of pizza? Mine's cheese. And only talking about things you are interested in, or that you like. Jeff: I can eat a whole pizza! That's eight pieces. Kate: I don't think I could. Jeff: I could run a whole mile afterwards. Sarah: Mm-hmm. Jeff: I could run so fast, I bet I could set a school record. Kate: Wow.

Eric: But first, let's clean up. Eric: That was really fun. Because I was a good sport, everyone had fun, and I can play more games with them another time. Kiara: I had a nice time playing with Eric. He was nice even when I won. I’d like to play with him again. Eric: When I play games with others, I pick a game that we've all agreed on. I ask if everyone knows the rules, so we all know how to play the game. If someone doesn’t know how to play, I make sure to clearly explain the rules so they can enjoy the game too. Then we set up the game. It shouldn’t take too long because we want to save the most time to play the game. After we’re done, I always say ""good game"" whether I win or lose.

Rejection can happen in our relationships, like when someone tells us ‘no’, excludes, or breaks up with us. It can also result from life events, like when we don’t make a team or an audition. When we experience rejection, we can often feel sadness, disappointment, embarrassment, or anger. Rejection can be small, medium or big. It’s important to know how to handle all kinds of rejection. It’s a part of life and happens to all of us. Small levels of rejection cause temporary hurt or sadness. Our reaction to small rejections should also be small. We usually don’t say anything or show our feelings. We try to stay calm and move on from it. Medium-sized rejections cause us longer lasting feelings of sadness or shame. Medium rejections are things like your friends repeatedly hanging out without you, relationship break-ups, or losing a friend. For medium-sized rejections, we’re careful who sees our reaction. If we’ve been rejected in front of others, we often hide how upset we feel. It’s too much emotion to show publicly. We try to hide the emotion until we are in private or with close friends or family who will listen, care, and help us feel better. Big levels of rejection are hurtful, rare, and unforgettable. They don’t happen often, but they can really hurt when they do happen. Big rejections are things like losing your entire group of friends. When a big rejection happens, we need a lot of time to deal with it. We take time to talk to our friends or family. Rejection does not feel good, but we can control our reaction so that we handle it gracefully. To Handle Rejection, we: Stop and think Is this rejection small, medium, or big? Match your reaction with the size of the situation. Share your feelings with trusted people in your life. "," - Everyone experiences rejection sometimes. Rejection can happen in our relationships, like when someone tells us ‘no’, excludes, or breaks up with us. It can also result from life events, like when we don’t make a team or an audition. When we experience rejection, we can often feel sadness, disappointment, embarrassment, or anger. Rejection can be small, medium or big. It’s important to know how to handle all kinds of rejection. It’s a part of life and happens to all of us. Small levels of rejection cause temporary hurt or sadness. Our reaction to small rejections should also be small. We usually don’t say anything or show our feelings. We try to stay calm and move on from it. Medium-sized rejections cause us longer lasting feelings of sadness or shame.

Waiting means we don’t get to do something right away. We might not like it when we have to wait. We might want to just reach out and take something, but we have to keep safe hands. Safe hands means keeping our hands to ourselves. When we take things and put our hands on other people, it can make them feel upset and not want to play with us. Instead of taking something, we can use our words to ask for it. We can say, “Can I use that?” or “Can I have a turn with that?” If we have to wait, we can make sure we stay calm. Better choices to help us wait are take deep breaths, pick another item, or make a new plan. When we have to wait for something, we always use safe hands. We keep our hands to ourselves. If we’re feeling frustrated, we can use strategies to stay calm. We can pick another toy to play with, take deep breaths, or make a new plan. If we feel angry, or like we might hurt someone, we stop right away and tell an adult we need a break. Now, let’s see what happens when Tommy does and does not use safe hands. Tommy: Hey, can I play? Sam: You can have a turn when I’m finished. Tommy: But I want a turn right now! Sam: Hey! It’s not your turn! Tommy: But I want to play now! Teacher: Tommy, stop that. You're not getting any computer time today. Tommy didn’t wait his turn and got in Sam’s space. How do you think this made Sam feel? Sam: I don’t want to be friends with Tommy. He makes me so mad. How did Tommy feel when he had to wait? Tommy: I wanted to play on the computer! Sam’s been on the computer for 20 minutes already! Sam was feeling mad that Tommy tried to take the computer from her. Nobody likes it when other people touch them. Tommy should have kept safe hands and waited his turn. Let’s watch when Tommy makes a better choice. Tommy: Hey, can I play? Sam: You can have a turn when I’m finished. Tommy: I feel really mad. I want to take the computer. But that’s not okay to do. I’ll just wait my turn. What can I do while I’m waiting? I can see if I can read that book for a bit. SAM: Hey Tommy. You can use the computer now. Tommy: Thanks! That time, Tommy used safe hands while waiting for what he wanted. He knew that nobody likes it when other people touch them. Let’s see how this made everyone feel. Sam: I’m glad Tommy waited his turn so I could finish playing. Tommy: I'm gald I used safe hands while I waited my turn. Now both of us are happy. By using safe hands and waiting his turn, Tommy still got to play on the computer and others had good feelings about him. It can be hard to wait, but it will keep others happy and keep us out of trouble if we always use safe hands. So, what did we learn? When we have to wait for something, we should: Use safe hands – we keep our hands to ourselves. If we’re feeling frustrated, we can use strategies to stay calm. We can pick another toy to play with, take deep breaths, or make a new plan. If we feel angry, or like we might hurt someone, we stop right away and tell an adult we need a break.

We'll watch each situation and think about how the character's actions make everyone else feel. Each character will come to a social fork, a time when they can control how the interaction will go. One path leads to others feeling positive about the situation, while another path might lead to negative outcomes. Your job is to pick the best path for each character. In this video, the fork is all about conversation skills. We'll see what happens when we take things literally, shift the topic too early, and don't give our listeners enough information to understand our story. All of these errors end up confusing the people around us. We'll see how to pick the path that leads to a successful conversation. Let's get started. Rachel is working as part of a group when she comes to a social fork. Let's watch. Leah: So, what do we have left in the project? Zach: Let's see, we have the 2000-word essay, the poster, and our presentation in front of the class, so you know, not that much at all. Rachel is at a social fork. She's confused by what Zach said. On one side of the fork, she could try to figure out what Zach meant. Did he really mean what he was saying? In the other path, she takes what he said literally and tells him that it seems like more work than he thought. What do you think will happen down each path? Let's see how each path goes. First, we'll see what happens when Rachel takes what Zach said literally. Leah: So, what do we have left in the project? Zach: Let's see, we have the 2000-word essay, the poster, and our presentation in front of the class, so you know, not that much at all. Rachel: That seems like a lot of work. Why did he say it wasn't going to be that much? Um... That seems like a lot of work. Zach: Oh, no, no, I was being sarcastic. I know we have a lot of work. Rachel: Oh, okay. Let's see how that made Zach feel. Zach: I think Rachel got confused there. I don't think she realized I was joking. Watch what happens when Rachel tries to figure out what Zach meant. Leah: So, what do we have left in the project? Zach: Let's see, we have the 2000-word essay, the poster, and our presentation in front of the class, so you know, not that much at all. Rachel: That seems like a lot of work. Why did he say it wasn't going to be that much? Everyone else is laughing. That probably means he was joking. When he said it, his voice changed to a different tone. It sounded like he was being sarcastic. He probably meant the opposite like it will take a long time. I could make a joke too. Yeah. It will take, what, 10, 15 minutes? Leah: Okay, let's get started. Let's see what Rachel was thinking after she took the time to think about what Zach was saying. Rachel: I'm glad I realized what Zach meant. I was able to be part of the group because I knew what was going on. Did those paths go the way you thought they were going to go? Which path would you pick? The best path was thinking about the way Zach was talking. He was being sarcastic and didn't mean what he said. Why was taking the time to think about the way Zach was talking the right path for Rachel to take? When Rachel took the time to think about what was going on, she realized that Zach was being sarcastic. When someone's being sarcastic, they're talking indirectly. Their words have a different meaning because of the way they say them. When someone's being sarcastic, they usually mean the opposite of what their words are saying or they're making a joke. If we can understand when people are being sarcastic, it will help us follow along in conversations and understand what others are saying. In this scene, Justin and Zach are talking about a class project when Justin has a thought. Zach: Hey, Justin. Justin: Hey! Zach: Our History project is due next week. Um, when do you want to work on it? Justin: I could do it after school today. Zach: Okay, yeah, that sounds good. Do you want to meet in the library? Justin: I totally forgot. I wanted to ask Zach if he's seen the new Wonder Woman movie. I'm dying to talk with him about it. Justin has come to a social fork. He could continue to talk about the class project or he could shift the topic to talking about the movie. What do you think will happen down each path? Let's see how each path goes. First, we'll see what happens when Justin shifts the conversation to the Wonder Woman movie. Zach: Hey, Justin. Justin: Hey! Zach: Our History project is due next week. Um, when do you want to work on it? Justin: I could do it after school today. Zach: Okay, yeah, that sounds good. Do you want to meet in the library? Justin: I totally forgot. I wanted to ask Zach if he's seen the new Wonder Woman movie. I'm dying to talk with him about it. Have you seen the new Wonder Woman movie yet? Zach: Um... no. No, I haven't. Why? Justin: It's so awesome! You have to see it. Zach: Okay. I guess I will. Let's see how Zach felt when Justin shifted the topic. Zach: I asked him a question and he didn't even answer me. He just started talking about a movie. Did he even hear me? Zach felt confused when Justin shifted the topic. So let's watch what happens when he continues talking about the project. Zach: Hey, Justin. Justin: Hey! Zach: Our History project is due next week. Um, when do you want to work on it? Justin: I could do it after school today. Zach: Okay, yeah, that sounds good. Do you want to meet in the library? Justin: I totally forgot. I wanted to ask Zach if he's seen the new Wonder Woman movie. I'm dying to talk with him about it. But... that can probably wait. I should answer his question. Yeah, I can do that. Zach: Great! Let's meet by the computers. Justin: Okay. Sounds good. Hey, by the way, have you seen the new Wonder Woman movie? Zach: No, I haven't. Justin: You need to! It's so good. Zach: I definitely will then. Don't spoil it. Justin: I won't. Let's see how he felt when Justin stayed on topic. Zach: I'm glad we got that settled. I was getting nervous that we wouldn't finish our project in time. Justin waited for a pause in the conversation before shifting the topic to what he wanted to talk about. Zach and Justin were able to finish the conversation and still talk about what Justin wanted. Did those paths go the way you thought they were going to go? Which path would you pick? The best path for Justin was to stay on topic until he found the right time to change the topic. How did he know the right time? When we shift the topic, we should wait until the first topic is done until we talk about the second topic. Remember, we ride out each topic like a surfer riding a wave. We ride out the first topic until it's done before jumping to a new one. If we jump too early, our surfer will crash and people will be confused. When you want to change to a new topic, give your listeners a clue and make sure it's the best time. You can say something like ""So I heard..."" or ""Did you hear about..."" This lets people know you're about to shift the topic. Connor and Madison are discussing what they did this weekend. Let's watch what happens when they arrived at a social fork. Connor: What did you do this weekend? Madison: Kevin and I went to the mall. Then we got pizza. Connor: Kevin? Madison: Yeah. He needed a dress shirt and tie, so I went with him. Madison is at a social fork. Connor seems confused by her story. She could keep telling her story or she could try to go back and give Connor more background information. What do you think will happen down each path? Let's see how each path goes. First, we'll see what happens when Madison keeps going with the story. Connor: What did you do this weekend? Madison: Kevin and I went to the mall. Then we got pizza. Connor: Kevin? Madison: Yeah. He needed a dress shirt and tie, so I went with him. Yeah, Kevin had a job interview, so he needed a nice shirt. Connor: Who are you talking about? Is Kevin in our grade? Let's see how Connor felt when Madison kept telling her story. Connor: I have no idea who Kevin is. Why isn't she explaining who she's talking about? Madison continued to tell the story even though Connor was confused. Let's watch what happens when she chooses a different path. Connor: What did you do this weekend? Madison: Kevin and I went to the mall. Then we got pizza. Connor: Kevin? Madison: Yeah. He needed a dress shirt and tie, so I went with him. Madison: Hmm... Connor seems confused. What part of that could he be confused by? Hmm... going to the mall and getting pizza isn't confusing. I must have never told him about Kevin. Oh, sorry. Kevin is my older brother. He came back from college, so he's looking for a summer job. Connor: Cool! When did he get back? Madison: This weekend. Connor: Awesome! Let's see how Connor felt when Madison gave him background information. Connor: Her story makes a lot more sense now. Before, I had no idea who Kevin was. Did those paths go the way you thought they were going to? Which path would you pick? The best path was stopping to realize that Connor was confused and give him more background information to help him understand the story. How did giving more background information lead to a more successful conversation? When we're talking to people, we need to give them background information so they understand who, what, where and when we were doing something. We call this the Background Brief. That's all the information people need to understand your story. If we give people the background brief, they won't be confused when we tell a story. Nice job, everyone! You just saw our characters take paths that made the conversation confusing for everyone. We also saw what it looked like when they chose the best path to take. When we're talking to others, we can think about: Taking things literally and making sure we pay attention to sarcasm If we want to bring up a new topic, we figure out the best time to shift the topic. We also want to make sure we give enough background information when we tell others a story. Think about if you've come to any social forks when having conversations. If you or others seem to be confused, think about what happened and how you can move forward to have a successful conversation. See you next time!

If we don’t use the Restaurant Rules, we could make others feel uncomfortable or embarrassed. The Restaurant Rules include: Thinking about hygiene which means keeping clean. We wash our hands before we sit down, we don’t touch others’ food, and we use napkins. Another Restaurant rule is using our Self-Controller. Our self-controller keeps our body and our emotions calm. Staying calm helps us take our time, slow our movements, and enjoy other's company. The last Restaurant Rule is using manners, which means using polite actions at the table. Some polite actions include saying please and thank you, excusing yourself before leaving the table, and not talking with your mouth full.

This lesson models how to find the true meaning, whether they hear sarcasm, figures of speech, or indirect language.",Disguised Thoughts,,,,S200,N/A,https://res.cloudinary.com/everyday-speech/raw/upload/v1619083935/SubtitlesVTT/fYWGmIyyg1_S195_Disguised_Thought.vtt," - When we have a conversation, we should pay attention to the other person’s message. If the words they use don’t match their message or don’t seem to make sense, they may be using a Disguised Thought. Disguised Thoughts are when someone’s words have more than one meaning. They might be using: Humor, Sarcasm, or a Figure of Speech. The skills we need to uncover the Disguised Thoughts and reveal their true meaning are: Compare the words to the situation. Who is talking? What is the topic? Where are you? Check for humor or sarcasm. Is anyone laughing? Does the speaker have a smile on their face? Is their tone of voice different? Check for hidden intentions or a hidden message. Does the speaker want something from you? Are they using a phrase that you never heard before? Could their words have more than one meaning? Let’s see what it looks like when Serena doesn’t uncover the Disguised Thoughts. Serena: So, what do you have going on this weekend? Leah: I’m so excited because my cousins are coming to spend the weekend with us. Serena: Oh, that’s cool. Where are they coming from? Leah: New York. And it’s my birthday on Saturday, so we’re all going into the city to go to my favorite restaurant. I have so much to look forward to. I’m on cloud nine! Serena: Where is cloud nine? Leah: Oh, it just means that I’m really happy. Serena: Oh... Ok... What happened there? Serena didn’t realize that Leah was using Disguised Thoughts. Let’s see how this made everyone feel. Serena: I didn’t really get what Leah was saying. We were talking about her cousins coming from New York and... then she said she was on cloud nine. I still don’t really understand what she meant. Leah: Serena didn’t seem to get what I was saying. That was awkward. Leah was using Disguised Thoughts when she said, “I’m on cloud nine” but Serena didn’t stop to figure out what she meant. This made Leah feel awkward because the conversation broke down. Serena should have stopped to think about Leah’s words, the situation, and the hidden message. Let’s see what happens when Serena figures out the Disguised Thoughts. Serena: So, what do you have going on this weekend? Leah: I’m so excited because my cousins are coming to spend the weekend with us. Serena: Oh, that’s cool. Where are they coming from? Leah: New York. And it’s my birthday on Saturday, so we’re all going into the city to go to my favorite restaurant. I have so much to look forward to. I’m on cloud nine! Serena: Hmm... I’m not sure what Leah means. Maybe she’s using a Disguised Thought. I don’t know what cloud nine is, but... she also said she had a lot to look forward to. So, it probably means she’s happy. Serena: That sounds really fun! I hope you have a great birthday weekend! Leah: Thanks! Let’s break down what Leah was saying and how Serena figured out what she really meant. Leah said, ""It's also my birthday on Saturday. We're all going into the city to my favorite restaurant. I have so much to look forward to. I'm on cloud nine! Serena didn’t understand what cloud nine meant. This is the Disguised Thought. She listened to the other words that Leah was saying. Leah said, “I have so much to look forward to.” This is a clue that Serena used to understand her message. Serena also thought about the situation and how someone would feel. Most people are excited about their birthday. Serena also looked at Leah’s facial expression and listened to her tone of voice. Leah looked and sounded really happy. When she put all of these clues together, she was able to reveal Leah’s true message and figure out what the Disguised Thoughts meant. So, what did we learn? When a message doesn’t match the words someone is saying and we get confused, we need to uncover the Disguised Thoughts. The Skills we use to do this are: Compare the words to the situation. Who is talking? What is the topic? Where are you? Check for humor or sarcasm. Is anyone laughing? Does the speaker have a smile on their face? Is their tone of voice different? Check for hidden intentions or a hidden message. Does the speaker want something from you? Are they using a phrase or saying something that you've never heard before?

At each step, we’ll talk about the problem, and how we can solve it. The steps we’ll go through are: Identify the problem - what’s wrong? Figure out how big the problem is. Think of possible solutions to the problem. Pick a solution. Try that solution and then reassess it. How did it work? If our solution works, our problem is solved! If our solution doesn’t work, we can try again. Problem solving is a process. We won’t always go straight to the solution. This video is all about problems we might have in our day to day lives. Whenever we see this icon in the corner, we can stop and talk about how everyone is feeling. Let's get started! In this video, Josh has a problem when he arrives at school. Let’s see. Josh: Oh no! Liz: What's wrong? Josh: I don't have my backpack! I must have left it on the bus! It had my cell phone and wallet in there! Liz: That's not good! What are you going to do? Now we’ll tackle the first step of problem solving. We need to identify what the problem is. What’s the problem? Josh: My backpack is on the bus and it has all my things in it! Josh’s backpack is on the bus with some expensive things in there. The next step is to figure out how big the problem is. How big is the problem? Josh: If I lose my phone and wallet, that is a big problem! My parents would have to get involved. They'd have to buy me a new phone. This is a pretty big problem. We would put it as medium-big on the scale because losing his cell phone and wallet would cost money and involve other people - his family. It’s time for the next step - thinking of some possible solutions. What are some solutions to Josh’s problem? Josh: What should I do? I could wait until I get on my bus this afternoon and look for it. I could see if I can call my cell phone. Or I could talk to my teacher about it. You might have come up with different solutions, and that’s okay. The next step is to pick a solution. Should Josh Wait Until the Afternoon, Call his Phone, or Talk to the Teacher? Let’s watch Josh pick a solution. Josh: I don't think I can solve this by myself. I need to talk to my teacher if I want to get my things back. Josh decided that he needed to talk to his teacher right away. The final step is to try the solution and reassess. Let’s see Josh try his solution. Josh: Ms. Lehane? Can I talk to you about something? Teacher: Sure. Josh: I left my backpack on the bus this morning. I'm worried because it had my phone and wallet in there. Teacher: I can call the bus driver right now and let him know. Josh: Thank you! Teacher: The bus driver dropped your bag off at the office. Josh: Thank you so much! Let’s reassess. Do you think Josh picked the best solution? Josh: I'm so glad I was able to get my bag back. For big problems, I definitely want to get help from an adult. Josh was able to get his bag back! For a problem like that, Josh decided he needed to get an adult’s help right away. Nice job, Josh! "," - Welcome to Solve It, a game where we solve problems by going through them step by step.

We explain the importance of being able to tell how someone feels and model what it looks like when we stop to observe others' feelings. Students will learn that they can use the clues on the outside to tell how someone feels on the inside.,Identifying Feelings,,,,,,https://res.cloudinary.com/everyday-speech/raw/upload/v1619172304/SubtitlesVTT/utUshEJ8d4_M111_We_All_Have_Feelings_Introduction.vtt," - We all have feelings. Feelings are the way your heart and body feel to you. Feelings change all day long. We might wake up feeling sleepy, then feel excited to go to school. After playing, we might feel angry that playtime is over. Other people have feelings too. These feelings change when different things happen. It’s our job to read other's feelings. We can’t see people’s feelings, but we can use the clues we see on the outside to guess their feelings on the inside. The outside clues we look for are changes in someone’s face and body. When we read other's feelings, we might change what we say and do. We do this to be a good friend. We have feelings that change all day long and so do other people. We can read other's faces and bodies to guess how they feel. We use the clues we see on the outside to guess the feelings on the inside. Knowing how other people feel tells us what to do or say. This helps us be a good friend. Let’s see what reading people’s feelings looks like. Tommy: I can’t wait for lunch today. It’s pizza day. Nikki: I just have a turkey sandwich, again. Jayden: Oh no! I forgot lunch money! Tommy: I wonder how my friends are feeling about lunch. Nikki is looking down, and her voice got quiet. She seemed disappointed to have turkey again. Jayden put his head in his hands when he said he forgot his lunch money. This told me he was upset. I should say something nice to both of them to make them feel better. Well, I love turkey sandwiches. I get them all the time, too. Nikki: Yeah, they’re not so bad. Tommy: And Jayden, maybe we could talk to the teacher and see if you can borrow lunch money. Jayden: You think I can do that? Nikki: Yeah! And I have some extra snacks I could share with you, Jayden. Jayden: Thanks, guys. Tommy: Now my friends are having new feelings. They’re smiling, so I think they’re feeling happy now. Nikki: I’m glad Tommy saw that I was feeling disappointed and made me feel better. That’s why I like talking to him. Jayden: I’m happy Nikki and Tommy saw how I felt. Now, I’m not worried about lunch. Tommy: I could tell by watching how my friends acted that they were not happy about their lunch. It’s important to look for clues about how my friends feel. People don’t always say how they’re feeling with words, but their faces and bodies give me lots of clues. When I saw Nikki look down at her lunchbox, it was a clue that she was feeling disappointed about her lunch. I saw Jayden put his head in his hands. This told me he was upset that he didn’t have any lunch money. When I read my friends’ feelings, I knew I should say something nice to them. Everyone has their own thoughts and feelings. It’s our job to read other's feelings. We can use the clues we see on a person’s face and notice what their body is doing to guess the feelings on the inside. When we read people’s feelings, we’re being a good friend. We can change what we say and do to match how they feel. So, what did we learn? We have feelings that change all day long and so do other people. We can read other's faces and bodies to guess how they feel.

They are a normal part of life. Sometimes, a problem happens when we do not think about our actions and how they will make others feel. For example, forgetting to wish a friend a happy birthday, being too bossy with friends at recess, or getting upset at a brother or sister and being unkind to them. Other times, a problem happens by accident and is out of our control, like when our favorite game breaks or outdoor recess is canceled. How we handle and react to our problems is important. To help us be better problem-solvers, we can use the Problem-Solving Steps. These steps help us solve problems quickly and on our own. To solve a problem, we: Identify the problem This means figuring out what our problem is. Think about the size of the problem Is it a small or big problem? We solve small problems by ourselves. We need adults for big problems. Come up with a few solutions Stop and think about the different ways we could solve our problem. Pick the best solution Think each solution through, playing it out in our minds. If we are unsure of the best solution, we can ask a friend or adult. If we need to ask for help, we could say: ""Can you help me solve a problem I’m having?” Or... “Can you help me decide what to do?” Test our solution After we try a solution, we ask ourselves, “Is my problem solved?” We might feel relieved or calm because the problem is gone. Teachers, pause here to discuss and review the problem-solving steps with your class. For extra practice, you can try this one out. A group of kids in class keep inviting your friends to play but not you. Some of these kids are nice but some can be mean. What should you do? Here are some more tips to remember. Try New Solutions Problems can come up unexpectedly. If the first solution we pick doesn’t work, we try another until the problem is solved. Ask for Help It’s okay to ask for help when we need it. Sometimes, we have big problems that need the help of an adult or teacher, like when many people are mad at us, or we see unsafe behavior at school. Handle problems early If we ignore a problem, we could end up making it worse or harder to solve. It is always best to try to use our Problem-Solving Steps as soon as we notice a problem. DISCUSSION: When is a time you could have used better problem-solving skills? What is the first step to solving a problem? Give examples of problems that would always need an adult’s help.

Say: Hi, Hey, Hello, Good morning, or anything that addresses the person we’re talking to. Make sure to say their name so they know you’re talking to them. Next, we usually make a comment or ask a question that starts people thinking and talking about the same thing. Then, watch for clues in their voice, body, and face to see if they’re interested. If they don’t seem interested, end the conversation. If they are interested, keep it going by taking more turns talking and listening. To start a conversation, we: Plan a topic the person will like or use small talk. Greet the person. Comment or ask a question to start the topic. Watch for interested clues. End the conversation if they look bored or busy. Keep the conversation going if they look interested. Let's see when Sarah starts a conversation with Mike. Sarah: Hey, Mike. Mike: Hey, Sarah. Sarah: How was your weekend? Mike: It was nice. How was yours? Sarah: Pretty good. I went to the beach. Sarah and Mike greeted each other and had a quick conversation about the weekend. Next, Mike needs to decide if Sarah is interested in keeping the conversation going. Let's watch two different situations. One where Sarah is interested and one where she isn’t. Will Mike notice? Mike: Did you see the baseball game last night? Sarah: I did. What a good game! Mike: Sarah’s looking at me and smiling. I think she wants to keep talking. I can’t believe they won after being down by so much. Sarah: I know, right? Mike could tell Sarah was interested in talking because she was looking at him, had a happy tone of voice, and smiled. Let's see what it looks like if Sarah is not interested. Mike: Did you see the baseball game last night? Sarah: No, I didn’t see it. Mike: Sarah is looking down at her phone and she's turning away from me. I think she needs to leave, so we should stop talking. Okay, I’ll talk to you later then. Sarah: I gotta rush to class, but I'll see you at lunch. Mike: Okay. That time, Sarah was not interested in talking more. Mike read the clues from her body language. She was looking at her phone and turning her body away from him, so Mike did the right thing by ending the conversation.

Learn the reasons why it’s safer to keep social media private and not be lured into the idea that more followers are equal to more friends.,Cyber Skills,,,,,,https://res.cloudinary.com/everyday-speech/raw/upload/v1619172305/SubtitlesVTT/M150_Cyber_Skills_Staying_Safe.vtt," Using our phones and social media can be a fun way to connect and stay in touch with our friends. We need to make sure we use our Cyber Skills, or else we could be putting ourselves in dangerous situations. Our Cyber Skills are smart ways to use technology to communicate with others and stay safe. First, we always want to communicate with people we know. We don't want strangers to have access to our information or be able to communicate with us. Don't ""friend"" or accept follows from people you don't know. Remember that photos can be fake. A dangerous adult could be behind the fake photo of someone who looks your age. When playing online games, create groups of real classmates or friends to play with. Also, never make plans to meet someone you've only talked to online. Second, keep your social media pages set on private. We can change the settings on our account so that only people we know see our information and pictures. Next, make sure not to tag your location on your social media posts. This can keep someone from finding out where you live. Cyber safety requires being honest with your parents. If something seems suspicious, tell a parent to make sure everyone stays safe. Cyber Skills keep you aware and safe while using devices that could connect you with dangerous people. Remember: Don't ""friend"" people you don't know. Keep social media pages private. Don't tag your location in posts. Never make plans to meet someone you've only talked to online. Let's see what happens when Anika and Emma talk about Cyber Skills safety.

Anika: Yeah, but you don't know them, so who cares? I just like to stay connected with my friends. Emma: Yeah, I guess that's true. I really only care about my friends seeing what I post. I'll delete the people I don't know. Emma: I didn't really think about who's actually seeing my posts. Anika: Emma was way too public with her phone. You never know who people really are online. Emma: I didn't realize I was leaving myself open to all sorts of weird situations. I never thought about older people pretending to be young with fake pictures but that happens all the time. Before, I just wanted lots of followers, but that's not really important. I'd rather keep my account private. I'll make sure not to accept anyone I don't know. I don't really want other people knowing where I am or where I live, so I won't tag my location in posts anymore. Emma feels relieved now that she's learned some ways to stay safe online.

Never make plans to meet someone you've only talked to online. "," Using our phones and social media can be a fun way to connect and stay in touch with our friends. We need to make sure we use our Cyber Skills, or else we could be putting ourselves in dangerous situations. Our Cyber Skills are smart ways to use technology to communicate with others and stay safe. First, we always want to communicate with people we know. We don't want strangers to have access to our information or be able to communicate with us. Don't ""friend"" or accept follows from people you don't know. Remember that photos can be fake. A dangerous adult could be behind the fake photo of someone who looks your age. When playing online games, create groups of real classmates or friends to play with. Also, never make plans to meet someone you've only talked to online. Second, keep your social media pages set on private. We can change the settings on our account so that only people we know see our information and pictures. Next, make sure not to tag your location on your social media posts. This can keep someone from finding out where you live. Cyber safety requires being honest with your parents. If something seems suspicious, tell a parent to make sure everyone stays safe.

Sometimes we give up all of what we want to get what we want next time, or another time in the future. It's like an agreement that requires each person to keep track of who got what last time. ",Compromising,,,,,,https://res.cloudinary.com/everyday-speech/raw/upload/v1619172302/SubtitlesVTT/M142_-_Compromising_Over_Time.vtt," A compromise is a negotiation or discussion to reach an agreement. We learn to be good negotiators by explaining our views and accepting agreements. There are a couple ways we can compromise. Two people can each get half of what they want. But this isn’t possible for every compromise. Another way to compromise is by giving others their choice this time and agree to get ours another time. First, we need to know what makes a good negotiation or compromise. A good compromise creates a win-win for everyone. A win-win means that each side feels like they won something. Good negotiators make a list in their minds of what is important to them. With this mental list, you can tell people which part is most important to you and give up what’s less important to you. A good compromise is fair. Every person can’t get everything they want, but they need to feel like they’re getting some of what they want, even if it’s in the future, like getting their way next time. Good negotiators realize that fairness usually equals out with time. If someone else is getting a better deal this time, there will be other opportunities to have your way another time. Lastly, good compromisers use good listening skills and polite language. Compromises are not arguments; they’re small, respectful agreements with people. We are careful not to negotiate too often with adults because it’s disrespectful. To Compromise, we: Expect to give up something. That can be half of what we want or waiting to get your way. Decide what’s important to you. Agree to someone’s suggestion even if it seems like they are getting a better deal this time. You will probably get a better deal next time. Compromises aren’t perfectly fair every time, but they usually equal out over time. Let’s see if Kai understands how to negotiate a good compromise. Kai: Have you picked your author yet? Emma: Not yet but I know the one I want is still available. Kai: The one I want is left, too! Emma: I’m going to pick Lewis Carroll. Kai: I was going to pick him too. Emma: I just read a whole book on him. I was really hoping to pick him. Kai: Well... I can pick someone else. Emma: Really? Thank you! That was so nice of Kai to let me choose Lewis Carroll. I’ll think of this for the next time that I can help him out. Kai: We both couldn’t have the same person, so I let Emma have what she wanted. It wasn’t a big deal to give that up. Kai: It’s not always a big deal to give up what I wanted and compromise to make others feel happy. I'm sure people will remember that I was nice and help me another time. Kai did a great job of compromising with Emma. He knew he could give up what he wanted, and it wouldn’t be a big deal. Now, Emma will remember how nice Kai was, and be sure to do something nice for him in the future. To Compromise, we: Expect to give up something That can be half of what we want or waiting to get your way Decide what you want the least and most Agree to someone’s suggestion even if it seems like they are getting a better deal this time You will probably get a better deal next time Compromises aren’t always fair, but they usually equal out over time.

Asking directly means just saying what you want. An indirect way means you talk around it, but you don't actually come out and say what you want. The better you know someone, the more direct you can be. Asking in an indirect way is more gentle and can make both of you feel more comfortable. It can be helpful in situations where you're asking another person for something, but you don't want to make them feel like they have to say yes. It can be more polite too. Let's see what happens when Zach asks for something directly. Zach: I don't know what I'm going to do about this math quiz. I just don’t get how to factor. Justin: It’s pretty easy once you get the hang of it. Zach: You can do it? Why don't you tutor me? Justin: Oh… Well, sure. Zach: Great! We can meet up after school. Justin: Uhh... I guess. I don’t have plans today. Zach: Alright, thanks! Did Zach ask for help in a direct or indirect way? How do you think that made Justin feel? Justin: I’m happy to help Zach, but he’s being a little rude. I’m the one doing him a favor. Justin feels a little taken aback or surprised at how Zach asks for help.

Zach: That sounds great! Thank you! Justin: Yeah, no problem! When Zach used indirect language, he gave Justin a hint that he was struggling by telling him there were some parts he didn't understand. Then Zach waited for Justin to offer to help him instead of asking directly. This makes them both feel more comfortable because Justin is the one to make the decision not Zach.

When we share a picture of our friends on social media, we should stop to think about how they will feel about others seeing it. As soon as we post anything online, it becomes public. Our friends may not want you to share certain photos of them online. If we are worried that others may feel upset, we should ask their permission before we post. To help us know what to do and what not to do, we can use our Cyber Skills. Our Cyber Skills for posting photos on social media include: We always know the people we’re sharing with, so we stay safe. We stop to think about how it will make others feel before we post anything. If we aren’t sure if it will make others upset, we should ask for their permission first. Let’s see how Rachel feels when Alessandra posts a photo that they took in private. Rachel: What do you want to do tonight? Alessandra: I don’t know. We can just hang out and watch TV. Rachel: Okay. Did you see these pictures from Sara's vacation? Alessandra: Yeah, I did. I’m so jealous. Hey, we can take pictures, too. Rachel: Yeah. Alessandra: Let's take some. Rachel: Oh my god. I look so weird! Alessandra: Yeah, we both look crazy. Rachel: Hey, do you want some snacks? Alessandra: Yeah, sure. Rachel: Why did you post this picture of us? Everyone is commenting and I look so bad! Alessandra: Why are you so upset? It’s funny. Rachel: No... It was funny when it was just the two of us messing around. I didn’t want everyone to see this. How did posting this picture made Rachel feel? Let’s see what they're both thinking. Rachel: Why would Alessandra post that picture? I look so bad in it. We were just joking around when we took that picture and I didn't want a lot of people to see it. Alessandra: Why was Rachel so upset? We were just being silly. I don’t care if I look bad in a picture. Alessandra didn’t think about how Rachel would feel before she posted their silly picture on social media. They took the picture in private but once it was posted, it became public. Rachel didn’t want anyone to see the photo. When she saw it online, she felt upset and embarrassed because she cares if others see her looking silly or bad in a picture. Alessandra didn’t care if she looked silly, but she needed to put herself in Rachel’s shoes before posting. Remember, before making information about others public, we should think about how it will make them feel. If it could upset them, we should not post it. If we aren’t sure, we should ask their permission to make sure they would feel comfortable. Let’s watch what happens when Alessandra does remember to use her Cyber Skills. Rachel: What do you want to do tonight? Alessandra: I don’t know. We can just hang out and watch TV. Rachel: Okay. Did you see these pictures from Sara's vacation? Alessandra: Yeah, I did.

Rachel: No, no, no… Please don’t. I look so bad. Can we take another one that we both like? Alessandra: Sure. Rachel: Okay, that one is so much better. You can post it. Alessandra: Okay. Before we share a picture on social media, we need to stop and think about how it will make other people will feel.

SEL,Energizing Stretching Break,SEL-038,https://slp.everydayspeech.com/video/energizing-stretching-break,1,2,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,Aug-20,,This video guides students through a series of standing stretches for an energizing brain break that helps them wake up. ,Stretching Videos,,,,,,https://res.cloudinary.com/everyday-speech/raw/upload/v1619186998/SubtitlesVTT/SEL38_Energizing_Stretching_Break.vtt," Today, we are going to take an energizing stretch break. Stretching clears our minds and releases endorphins. Endorphins are calming chemicals in our brains. Our brain releases these chemicals when we exercise. Let’s see if we can use stretching to boost our energy and wake up our minds and bodies. Start by standing up and finding your own space. Put your arms out to make sure you are not too close to your neighbor. Your feet should be flat on the ground, shoulder distance apart. With your arms down by your sides, lightly shake out your hands. Start to wake up your body. Do this for five more seconds. Five, four, three, two, one. Now, let’s get some movement into our shoulders. Start rolling your shoulders in small circles forward for five, four, three, two, one. Good. Now, reverse your shoulders backwards for five, four, three, two, one. Give your shoulders one big squeeze up towards your ears and release. Next, with your feet hip-width apart, place your hands on your lower back. Make sure your fingers are pointed down like you're reaching into your back pockets. Roll your shoulders down and back once more. Stay in your stretch as you take three deep breaths here. Inhale in slowly for three, two, one. Exhale out slowly for three, two, one. Take two more deep breaths on your own time. Slowly release this stretch and come back to a standing position. Now, let’s wake up our lower body with a quad stretch. Balance on one leg as you lift your right foot up behind you, grabbing it with your right hand. Now, hold your foot to the back of your hip for a quad stretch. Use a chair for balance. Hold this stretch for three, two, one. Release your ankle, but try to keep your balance. Circle your foot three times before returning it to the ground. Let’s do the same on the other side. Bend your knee to bring your other ankle towards your hand. Grab your left ankle with your left hand and hold this stretch while you balance or hold onto something to help you balance. Hold this stretch for three, two, one. Release your ankle, but keep your balance while you circle your foot three times. Take one last big stretch with your arms as you reach them towards the sky and release. Take a moment to reflect on how your mind and body feel. Notice the difference between how you felt before and after you stretched. Are you feeling energized, happy, or relaxed? Great job releasing those happy endorphins! You’re ready to learn and tackle the rest of your day. "," Today, we are going to take an energizing stretch break. Stretching clears our minds and releases endorphins.

At parties, it can be hard to know what to talk about with other people. If we use our Topic Radar, we can remember what other people are interested in. People like talking about topics they enjoy, so we think about topics the person is interested in and pick one to ask them about. When eating a meal with others, there are certain behaviors we should follow so no one feels uncomfortable. The Restaurant Rules remind us how to use our manners during a meal with others. If being around lots of people makes us feel nervous, we can activate our Self-Controller. The Self-Controller helps us keep control of our emotions. We think of helpful strategies and find the best one to help us enjoy the party. When we go to a party, we should remember to: Use our Topic Radar when we talk to others, so we’ll know what to talk about with them. Think about the Restaurant Rules to help you know how to act at the table. Use our Self-Controller to keep control of our emotions and use strategies to stay calm. Let’s watch Connor use these strategies when he goes to a family party. Connor: Hey! Liz: Hey, how are you? Connor: I’m good. What’s up? Liz: Not much! Do you know when everyone else is coming? Connor: I’m not sure, but hopefully soon. Liz: Yeah, I’m excited to see everyone! Connor: I want to keep talking with Liz, so I need to talk about her interests and things we both like. I’ll use my Topic Radar. Hmm... I think she likes video games and hiking. I know she's into soccer. She plays on the school team. Connor: I heard you were picked for the school soccer team. Liz: I was. Tryouts were really hard. I’m amazed I made the team. Connor: Congratulations! What position do you play? Liz: I play forwards. It’s fun because forwards score the most goals. Connor: Oh, cool! Connor wasn’t sure what to talk about with his cousin Liz. He used his topic radar strategy to think about what Liz was interested in. Liz had fun talking with Connor because soccer is one of her favorite things. Connor: I’m really hungry, but nobody's sitting down yet. I don’t want to start without everyone. I guess I should wait. Connor really wanted to eat his food, but he thought about the Restaurant Rules and table manners. It would be rude to start eating without everyone sitting down, so Connor waited. This was polite and showed respect to others at the party. Connor: I’m starting to feel nervous. There's a lot of people I haven’t seen in a while. I know! I can use my Self-Controller. Stay calm and think about a strategy. Which strategy should I use? I could either take deep breaths, squeeze my fists, or go for a walk. I don’t want to be rude and leave, so I’ll take a few deep breaths. Connor was feeling nervous by being around so many people, but when he activated his Self-Controller, he was able to think of a couple of strategies he could use. Not all of his ideas were the best fit for a family dinner party, so he decided to pick a strategy he could do at the table. Connor took some deep breaths and was able to stay calm. Connor: I used to have a really hard time going to parties with a lot of people, but it was really helpful when I remembered to use strategies. Connor was able to find a strategy each time he had trouble at the party. Let’s review what we learned. The skills we can use when we go to a party are: Use our Topic Radar when we talk to others, so we’ll know what to talk about with them. Think about the Restaurant Rules to help you know how to act at the table. Use our Self-Controller to keep control of our emotions and use strategies to stay calm. Using all of these strategies can help turn a party from a scary or stressful event, to a positive one. Try to use them the next time you go to a family party.

Is the main character showing empathy, or not showing empathy? Concepts covered: Showing Empathy",Empathy Essentials,,,,A14,https://everydayspeechsocialskillsvideos.vhx.tv/videos/2-sides-empathy,https://res.cloudinary.com/everyday-speech/raw/upload/v1619082417/SubtitlesVTT/OskO7vWbvv_A014_Two_Sides_-_Empathy.vtt," - Welcome to Two Sides a game where we compare how people act in different situations. In this video, we’re going to compare Showing Empathy and Not Showing Empathy. When you show empathy, you are thinking about how it feels to be in someone else’s shoes. You understand how they feel and show them that you care. Sometimes this is called taking their perspective or seeing things from their point of view. When you don’t show empathy, you aren’t thinking about how it feels to be them. You don’t understand how they are feeling, so you aren’t able to help them. Every time we see this icon in the corner, we should stop and discuss what happened. Think about how everyone feels and why. Let’s get started! Mike isn’t having a very good day. Do Jeff and Sarah show empathy? Mike: Man, I'm having the worst day. Sarah: Oh no, I'm sorry. Jeff: I'm sorry to hear that. What's wrong? Mike: Well, first I forgot my homework at home and then I spilled water in my bag. Jeff: Man, that's rough. Sarah: I bet you can clean it out. Do you think Jeff and Sarah showed empathy or didn’t? Jeff and Sarah... Showed Mike empathy. Mike’s friends made him feel better. They used a sincere tone of voice. It sounded like they really felt bad for Mike. Mike: Man, I'm having the worst day! Sarah: Oh no, I’m sorry. Jeff: I’m sorry to hear that. What’s wrong? They moved their bodies towards Mike and looked at him to show they are listening. And their faces looked interested in what Mike had to say. By listening to Mike and showing him they understood what he was going through, they made him feel a little better. Can you think of a time you weren’t feeling well? Was there something someone did or said to make you feel better? Alessandra and Devin bump into each other. Let’s watch how Devin reacts. Alessandra: Bye! See you at lunch! Devin: What was that for? Alessandra knocked over all of Devin’s things. Did he look at the situation from Alessandra’s point of view? Devin... didn’t show empathy. When they knocked into each other, Devin yelled at Alessandra. Alessandra: See you at lunch! Devin: What was that for? He also angrily grabbed his book back from her. If Devin took a second to think from Alessandra’s point of view, he might have realized that she probably didn’t bump into him on purpose. It was just an accident. Can you remember a time you had to apologize after an accident? How did the other person react? Graham didn’t do so well on the test. Does Nick show him empathy? Why or why not? Nick: I just got an A on my History midterm. It was so hard, I can't believe it. Graham: Oh, that's great. Nick: Hey, you sound upset. What's wrong? Graham: Uh, I didn't do so good. Nick: Hey, I'm sorry, man. It was a really hard test. Don't worry about it. Did Nick show empathy? Nick... showed Graham empathy. How could he tell that Graham wasn’t feeling very happy? Graham had his head in his hand. He was looking at the ground. And Graham’s voice didn’t sound very excited. Graham: Oh, that’s great. Nick read the clues, and figured out that Graham was upset about something. He asked Graham what was wrong. Then, he made Graham feel better by telling him it was a difficult test. Nick did a great job adjusting his words and tone of voice once he found out that Graham was upset. Andrew is waiting for a swing when Julie comes up to use it. Does Julie think from Andrew’s perspective? Andrew: Hey, that's not fair! I was waiting! Julie: But I really wanted to use the swing. What do you think? Did Julie think about Andrew or show empathy? Julie... didn’t show empathy. Even though Andrew was waiting, she took the swing anyway. Even when Andrew told Julie he was waiting, she didn’t take the time to think about it from his point of view. What if she was waiting? How would she feel if someone else took the swing? Has there ever been a time you did what someone else wanted because you thought it was the fair thing to do? The whole group is going to play a game, except for one person. Does the group show Tim empathy? Alessandra: What should we do? Any ideas? Mike: Hmm, we could play cards. Alessandra: That's a good idea. What game? Ryan: How about Go Fish? Mike: Yeah, that sounds fun. Alessandra: Alright. Let's go! Tim: But... I wanted to play too! Nobody in this class likes me! The group made a plan to play a card game, but Tim wasn’t invited. Did they take his perspective into account? The group... didn’t show empathy. Tim was sitting right next to the group, but didn’t get asked to play. That made him feel very upset and sad. If the group took a second to think about Tim, they would realize that it doesn’t feel good to be left out. Next time, they should try to include everyone in the game. Let’s watch what happens when Matt and Josh get into a disagreement. Matt: Hey Josh, why didn't you tell me you are all going out for pizza after school? Josh: What do you mean? I thought you had practice. Matt: It got cancelled so now I have nothing to do! Josh: Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you feel left out. I just didn't even think of inviting you because I thought you couldn't come. Matt: Oh, okay. I shouldn't have assumed you knew. Josh: It's okay. You can definitely come! Matt: Sounds good! Did they show empathy towards each other? If so, how? Matt and Josh... showed empathy. Matt started off angry, but when he talked to Josh, each person explained their side. They were able to solve their disagreement in a positive way. Each person said something they did wrong, and apologized to the other person. Josh: Oh, I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to make you feel left out. I just didn't even think of inviting you because I thought you couldn't come. Matt: Oh, okay. I shouldn’t have assumed you knew. Josh: It's okay. You can definitely come. Matt: Sounds good! If we take the time to think about what part of the disagreement we are responsible for, we can fix it. It’s hard to think about the other person’s side when we’re mad, but it’s important to do that so small problems don’t turn into big ones. Jeff and Mike are having a disagreement. How does Mike handle it? Mike: Hey Jeff, I need to talk to you! Jeff: What's up? Mike: I think what you did was really rude! Jeff: What's wrong? Mike: You know I was taking everybody to the arcade on Friday night. I thought you were coming too! Jeff: Yeah, I am. What's wrong? Mike: Forget it. I don't want to talk to you anymore! Jeff: I don't want to talk to you either! Did Mike look at it from Jeff’s point of view? Mike... didn’t show empathy. Mike came into the conversation mad and started it off angry. Mike: Hey Jeff, I need to talk to you! Jeff: What's up? Mike: I think what you did was really rude! He also didn’t listen to the words Jeff was saying. Jeff didn’t know what the problem was. Jeff: What's wrong? Mike didn’t think about how Jeff was feeling. He was so upset, he didn’t understand that Jeff didn’t know what he was talking about. Mike: Forget it! I don’t want to talk to you anymore! Jeff: I don't want to talk to you either! Mike needs to take the time to think from Jeff’s point of view. How can Jeff help him solve the problem if he doesn’t know what’s wrong? Can you remember a time you had a disagreement with a friend? How did you feel when it was happening? Did you feel any different later? Alessandra just got some bad news. Does Mike show empathy? Mike: Hey, Alessandra. What's wrong? Alessandra: My grandfather passed away a few days ago. Mike: Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. I'm sorry for your loss. Alessandra: Thanks. He was such a great guy. Mike: Let me know if there's anything I can do for you. Alessandra: Thanks. What do you think? Did Mike show empathy? Mike... showed Alessandra empathy. He noticed that Alessandra wasn’t feeling great, and asked her what was wrong. How did he know? She was looking down and her shoulders were slumped. When Alessandra told him that her grandfather passed away, Mike told her that he was sorry for her loss. Mike: Oh no! I’m sorry to hear that. I'm sorry for your loss. That’s something nice we can say to someone when somebody close to them has passed away. Mike also let Alessandra know that he was there to help her if she needed it. Mike: Let me know if there’s anything I can do for you. Alessandra: Thanks. Mike thought about Alessandra, and how it would feel to be in that situation. Great job, everyone! We learned a lot about empathy today! Remember, you can show empathy by understanding how someone else feels. This is also called Perspective Taking, or seeing things from someone else’s point of view. If we can understand how someone else is feeling, it makes it easier to solve a problem, or make them feel better. See you next time! "," - Welcome to Two Sides a game where we compare how people act in different situations. In this video, we’re going to compare Showing Empathy and Not Showing Empathy. When you show empathy, you are thinking about how it feels to be in someone else’s shoes. You understand how they feel and show them that you care. Sometimes this is called taking their perspective or seeing things from their point of view. When you don’t show empathy, you aren’t thinking about how it feels to be them. You don’t understand how they are feeling, so you aren’t able to help them. Every time we see this icon in the corner, we should stop and discuss what happened. Think about how everyone feels and why. Let’s get started! Mike isn’t having a very good day. Do Jeff and Sarah show empathy? Mike: Man, I'm having the worst day. Sarah: Oh no, I'm sorry. Jeff: I'm sorry to hear that. What's wrong? Mike: Well, first I forgot my homework at home and then I spilled water in my bag. Jeff: Man, that's rough. Sarah: I bet you can clean it out. Do you think Jeff and Sarah showed empathy or didn’t? Jeff and Sarah... Showed Mike empathy. Mike’s friends made him feel better. They used a sincere tone of voice. It sounded like they really felt bad for Mike. Mike: Man, I'm having the worst day! Sarah: Oh no, I’m sorry. Jeff: I’m sorry to hear that. What’s wrong? They moved their bodies towards Mike and looked at him to show they are listening. And their faces looked interested in what Mike had to say. By listening to ",0.7971264215

If we only think about our own thoughts or needs, we can act in a way that others find odd for the situation. To Read the Room, we first think about the rules for that particular place. We ask ourselves, “What are the rules or behaviors that are okay for this place?” Next, observe the situation by looking at others’ actions. To figure out how we should act, we can look at others and copy what they are doing. Then, notice others’ mood and energy levels and try to match them. For example, if we approach a group that’s upset, we respect the group by also acting seriously. If the group looks like they’re having fun, we can join in the fun. Last, think about how others want us to act. To do this, think about the needs of the group. Every group has a need. It can be to have fun, to learn, to sympathize, or to share information. Good group members figure out the group’s need. For example, if we join a group while one person is sharing a sad story, we become a good group member by empathizing and comforting the sad person. If the group is having fun, we can join in and save our sad feelings for another time. When we put the clues together, we can make a decision on how we should act.

Sarah was really excited about the decorations, but did she Read the Room to match the mood and help the needs of the group? Let’s see how the group felt. Mike: Didn’t Sarah see we were working on something? She just kept talking. Kate: I like talking to Sarah, but right now I have to finish my work. They felt annoyed. Sarah should have noticed their rushed body language and lack of eye contact when she approached. She missed seeing the group’s need to finish their project. Let’s watch her try again. This time, let's see if Sarah notices the mood and needs of the group. Sarah: I want to go talk to my friends. Uh-oh. I need to stop and think first. Hmm... Do they look busy?

In this video, we’re going to decide if people used their Cyber Skills to stay safe online or not. Our Cyber Skills are smart ways to stay safe while we communicate with others online and use technology. First, we always want to communicate with people we know. We don’t want strangers to have access to our information or be able to communicate with us. Don’t “friend” or accept people you don’t know and remember that photos can be fake. The person behind the photo may be a completely different person or age. Second, keep your social media pages private. We can change the settings of our accounts so that our information and pictures are only viewable to those we know personally. Next, make sure not to tag your location on your social media posts. This can keep someone from finding out where you live. Last, report inappropriate content such as bullying, hate speech, or obscenities to the social media so that they can be removed. If something seems suspicious, tell a parent to make sure everyone stays safe. Cyber Skills keep you aware and safe while using devices that could connect you with dangerous people. Remember: Don’t “friend” people you don’t know. Keep social media pages private. Don’t tag your location in posts. Play online video games with friends you know, not strangers. Never make plans to meet someone you’ve only talked to online. We are going to watch four scenes and decide if each person was using their Cyber Skills or not. Every time we see this icon in the corner, stop and discuss what happened in the scene. Decide if the characters used their Cyber Skills successfully. Watch to see if they keep online safety in mind while playing online games, using social media, and talking to friends. Let’s get started! Niko: I'm adding WarriorDude to our party. Shay: Who is he? Niko: I don’t know, but he can get us to level 12. Shay: I only game with people I know. It’s safer that way. Niko: Yeah, I guess we don't know him. Shay: We don’t need to add him. I think we can get to Level 12 on our own. Niko: Okay, sounds good. Did Niko use his Cyber Skills? Niko did use his cyber skills. He chose not to invite a stranger into their game. Why don’t we play video games with strangers? The reason we don’t play video games with strangers is because adults may pretend to be our friend, then ask us to do inappropriate things, like join them in a chat room or video chat or other dangerous situations. It’s best to only invite or play online games with people you know. Let’s take a look at another situation. Kiara: I don’t know. I have a soccer game to go to and then after, I'm going with my parents... Liz: Look, he's sleeping. Isaac: Gosh, he’s so weird. Liz: I'm going to post this. Kiara: That’s not funny. Don’t be mean. Liz: Oh, come on, who cares? Kiara: I care. We aren’t going to be mean to people. Isaac: She’s right. I’d feel bad if other people saw that. Liz: Yeah, I guess that’d be pretty mean. Kiara: So, anyway, after the soccer game in the afternoon I'm going with my parents to see a movie. Did Kiara use her Cyber Skills? She did! Kiara stopped cyber bullying. When you see something that is mean or wrong to say about a person or group of people, you have a responsibility to act and protect the person who’s being bullied. That’s another way to keep yourself and others feeling happy and safe online. Have you ever seen a message that looked like a joke, but it hurt someone’s feelings? Let’s look at another situation. Shay: Oh my gosh, you have so many followers. Anika: I know, isn’t it cool? Shay: Hey... are they all people we go to school with? Anika: I don’t know. Most of them aren’t people I exactly know. Shay: That’s not safe. I mean think about it. They could be anybody. Anika: Oh... I never thought about that before. Did Anika use her Cyber Skills? No, she did not. Anika lets anyone be her friend on social media and she assumes everyone is who they say they are. That’s dangerous because anyone can use a fake picture to pretend to be younger. It’s more safe to only accept social media requests from people you know. What’s the harm in accepting strangers as friends on social media? Let’s watch one more. Emma: Did I show you the pictures from my trip? It was so fun! Kai: No, you didn’t. Emma: We went to the beach every day. I miss it. Kai: It looks like you posted all of your vacation pictures while you were away. I always wait till I get home, just so nobody breaks into my house. Emma: I never thought about that! That’s really scary! Kai: Yeah, I also don't tag locations either. I don’t want anybody weird to find out where I live. Emma: Can you show me how to turn that off? I don’t want people to know that either. Kai: Oh, sure. Just go into your settings. Emma: Oh, thanks! Did Emma use Cyber Safety? No, she did not! She posted vacation photos while she was out of town, which lets people know that no one is home. This could be dangerous if the wrong people find out and want to steal things from your home. For safety reasons, we also keep our location services turned off for social media apps. We don’t want to give strangers a way to find us. What are some other ways to make sure strangers don’t know your location? What did we learn? We remember to use our Cyber Skills anytime we’re online. Using our phones and social media can be really fun, but it’s also a big responsibility. There are lots of ways we can stay safe like: Don’t “friend” people you don’t know. Keep social media pages private. Don’t tag your location in posts. Play online video games with friends you know, not strangers. Never make plans to meet someone you’ve only talked to online. "," Welcome to Two Sides, a game where we compare how people act in different situations. In this video, we’re going to decide if people used their Cyber Skills to stay safe online or not. Our Cyber Skills are smart ways to stay safe while we communicate with others online and use technology. First, we always want to communicate with people we know. We don’t want strangers to have access to our information or be able to communicate with us. Don’t “friend” or accept people you don’t know and remember that photos can be fake. The person behind the photo may be a completely different person or age. Second, keep your social media pages private. We can change the settings of our accounts so that our information and pictures are only viewable to those we know personally. Next, make sure not to tag your location on your social media posts. This can keep someone from finding out where you live. Last, report inappropriate content such as bullying, hate speech, or obscenities to the social media so that they can be removed. If something seems suspicious, tell a parent to make sure everyone stays safe. Cyber Skills keep you aware and safe while using devices that could connect you with dangerous people. Remember: Don’t “friend” people you don’t know. Keep social media pages private. Don’t tag your location in posts. Play online video games with friends you know, not strangers. Never make plans to meet someone you’ve only talked to online. We are going to watch four scenes and decide if eac",0.4328005318

It’s more important than winning or having more turns. Purposefully excluding others is a form of bullying. If we choose to ignore others or not invite or include them based on their differences, we are being hurtful. Some ways to include everyone are: Inviting someone to sit with you. Asking someone to play. Picking a new person as a class partner. We can invite others by saying things like: “Hey, want to join us?” or “Come play with us!” We try to think about others not just ourselves. It’s more fun for the group when everyone is invited to play and gets to take a turn. To include everyone, we make sure to: Take turns and invite others to play, no matter our differences. Consider others’ feelings, not just our own. Remember the Golden Rule: Treat others how you want to be treated. Let’s watch what happens when Connor and Haley don’t include Madison. Connor: Want to see a cool trick that I can do? Haley: Yeah, sure. Haley: I can make him run with super speed! Madison: Oh cool! I know how to make him do flips! Connor: I can make him do flips, too! Everyone but Madison got a turn to use the iPad. How did this make her feel? Madison: Connor and Haley got to show off their tricks, but no one gave me a turn. I don’t want to play with them anymore. Connor and Haley were making the game more important than Madison’s feelings. Madison felt excluded from the group. Let’s watch them try again. Connor: Want to see a cool trick that I can do in this game? Haley: Yeah, sure. Haley: I can make him run with super speed! Madison: Oh cool! I know how to make him do flips! Connor: I can make him do flips, too! Haley: Yeah, but it’s Madison’s turn. Connor: Oh, you’re right. Madison: Thanks. If you hold down, he’ll do a backflip! Haley: Cool! Connor and Haley included Madison in the group that time, which made it fun for everyone. Taking turns is a fair way to make sure everyone is included.

And one last deep breath in... and out. Take a moment to clear your mind of any negative thoughts or feelings. Focus your mind only on the movements and stretches we will be completing together.

Move your head back center and gently bring your chin to your chest and hold, three, two, one. Slowly bring your head back up, your chin pointing up to the ceiling and hold this position for three, two, one. Release your head back to the center, your gaze forward again.

Release this position and complete the same stretch on the other side. Put your left hand on your head and very gently pull it towards your shoulder to feel that same stretch on the other side, and release. Now bring your fingertips to your shoulders and make small circles forward with your shoulders. Check yourself. Is your mind wandering to other things? Try to keep it focused on how your muscles feel right now. Reverse the direction of your shoulder circles, moving them backwards. From this position, reach your hands all the way out to the sides. Flex your hands and make sure your fingers are pointed up towards the ceiling. Start to move your hands forward and back, like you’re waving to someone. Feel this stretch all the way through your arms to your fingertips. Slowly, move your arms in front of you and interlace your fingers. Round your upper back like a cat and bring your belly in towards your spine. Feel a deep stretch in your upper back. Hold for five, four, three, two, one and release. Let’s do one last stretch, bringing our arms above our heads, keeping our fingers interlaced. Gently lean your arms over to the right and bring them back center. Now, lean over to the left and bring it back center once more. Take a deep breath here in... and out. Release your arms from above your head to your sides.

We can think of a conversation like a train on tracks. We want to keep it running smoothly. For this conversation, we'll go through the following steps: Realize the conversation is off track. Is someone giving us signs that the conversation isn't going smoothly? Figure out where it went off track. Think of a way to get it back on track and running smoothly. Whenever we see this icon in the corner, we can stop and talk about how everyone is feeling. Let's get started. Madison is telling Connor about the school talent show. Let's watch the conversation. Madison: Did you go to the talent show on Friday? Connor: No. I had to go out to dinner with my family. Madison: It was so cool! Some of the teachers played in a band. Connor: Oh... I really wanted to go. Uh-oh! How do we think Connor is feeling during this conversation? The first step is to realize the conversation is off track. What clues was Connor giving Madison to let her know the conversation was off track? Let's see what Madison thinks. Madison: Connor is slumping his shoulders and sounds kind of sad. The next step is to figure out where the conversation went off track. Why was Connor looking upset? Let's take a look. Madison: Connor slumped down when I told him I went to the talent show. Then he said he couldn't go but wanted to. I think he's feeling upset that he missed it. Once we know the conversation is off track and why, we can figure out how to get it back on track. How do you think Madison could repair the conversation? Madison: It wouldn't be very nice to keep going on and on about the talent show if it makes Connor feel bad. I can ask him what else he did this weekend. Madison was able to realize that the conversation was making Connor feel bad, so she decided to change the subject. Let's watch her get the conversation back on track. Madison: Yeah. Well, that was the only exciting thing anyways. What else did you do this weekend? Connor: I had an indoor soccer game. Madison: You did? Cool! Did you play in the arcade after? Connor: Yeah. It was pretty fun. Madison was able to change the topic so they didn't keep talking about something that made Connor feel bad. We could tell Connor felt better when he talked about his soccer game because he sat up, smiled, and looked interested in the conversation. This conversation is now running smoothly. Solving problems in conversations can be tricky. If a conversation isn't going the way you expected, think about what's happening and observe the other person. How are they acting? Do they want to keep talking about the subject? Do they seem interested? You can go back and try to figure out where it went off track. That might give you some clues to get it back on track.

SEL,Getting Along with Siblings,SEL13,https://slp.everydayspeech.com/video/getting-along-with-siblings,1,2,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,Aug-20,,TEACHER SCRIPT: Today we're learning how to respect others. Can anyone name a way our group has shown more respect for each other? What is a way we can improve our respect for each other?,Showing Respect,,,,,,https://res.cloudinary.com/everyday-speech/raw/upload/v1619186995/SubtitlesVTT/SEL13_Getting_Along_with_Siblings.vtt," It can be difficult to get along with siblings when they compete with us for the same things, get us in trouble, bother us, or treat us unfairly. However, there are a lot of great things about siblings. They can be a playmate when you need one and a person who understands and supports you your entire life. To get along with siblings, you first need to know what kind of problem you are having. You will respond differently depending on the type of problem. Siblings usually have only two types of problems: a problem that needs both people to change, like when both people want the same thing and need to compromise. A problem that needs one person to change, like when one person is being unfair to the other. To compromise, one person states a deal where they get half of what they want and give the other person half of what they want. Expecting to get everything you want all of the time is not reasonable. You give half to get half. When you have a problem where only one person needs to change, like when one person is being mean or unfair, you need to speak up or nothing will change. If someone is being inconsiderate, it’s alright to ask for better treatment. Use an ""I feel"" statement to help them understand how you feel. To make an ""I feel"" statement, start by saying I feel _____ when you _____. Let’s try one for practice. “I feel angry when you tattle on me.” An ""I feel"" statement doesn’t blame the other person. It lets them see how they are making you feel. It should be said calmly without yelling or anger. ""I feel"" statements help families come to calm, clear understandings. Teachers, you may choose to pause here to help students practice using ""I feel"" statements. When we listen to ""I feel"" statements, we should be calm and understanding. This isn’t the time to yell, blame, or state your reasons. This is the time to hear someone’s honest feelings. Think about what you can change to help them feel better. Admitting you did something wrong means you sometimes have to say “You’re right,” “That’s a good point,” and even the hardest one, “I’m sorry.” As we figure out what kind of words different problems need, we change how we talk to treat each other better. DISCUSSION: To get along with siblings, What three things do you argue about with your siblings? Are these needing compromises or ""I feel"" statements? Practice making an ""I feel"" statement to your sibling, then make a compromise.

If something happened that made you feel upset, you might feel angry towards the person who did it. If it was an accident, you shouldn’t get angry at the person because they didn’t mean for it to happen. If it was done on purpose, we should stay calm but express our feelings in a polite way. To help us figure out whether something was done on purpose or not, think about the On Purpose Plan. The On Purpose Plan tells us: If someone plans something to hurt another person’s feelings, this is On Purpose. If someone didn’t plan it, then it was an Accident and we shouldn’t get upset at them. We can tell if someone has planned something by the way they react. Look closely at their facial expression and actions. Do they look surprised or angry that this happened? Let’s see what it looks like when Madison tries to figure out the On Purpose Plan to see when the actions are accidental and when they’re on purpose. Madison: I’m thirsty. Liz: How about a drink? Madison: Sure. I’ll take some water. Liz: I'll get it. Liz: Oh man, I’m really sorry. What a mess. I’ll clean it up! Madison: What did you do that for? Liz: I said I’m sorry. Are you okay? Madison: Liz looks upset and she apologized to me. She asked if I’m okay. Madison: I guess it was just an accident. I need to calm down and not take out my anger on her. Madison: Yeah, I’m okay. I guess it was just an accident. Liz: Do you want another glass of water? Madison: Sure! Madison was upset when the water was spilled on her. When she stopped to think about the On Purpose Plan, she realized that Liz didn’t spill the water on purpose. We can tell it was an accident because Liz apologized right away. Her body language looked upset and she offered to help clean it up. Madison was upset but she was able to keep control of her feelings. She didn’t stay angry at Liz because she knew it was an accident. Let’s see what happens when someone does plan something to hurt another person’s feelings on purpose. Madison: And... that’s another made it home! I only have one left. Connor: Ugh! I only have one in the home! That’s not fair! Who wants to play this game anyway? Madison: Why did Connor do that? That was no accident. He did that on purpose. I can tell from his facial expressions, words, and actions that Connor was angry that I was winning. Madison: Hey, that’s not cool! Connor: I’m sorry. I was just upset that I was losing, but I shouldn’t have done that. Madison: It’s okay. Just now we can’t finish the game. I don't care who wins or loses. I just wanted to have fun. Connor: Sorry. Maybe we could find something else to play. Madison: Yeah. Let’s think of something else. That time, Madison knew that Connor ruined the game on purpose because she noticed his facial expression, body language, and tone of voice. Madison felt upset that Connor knocked their game over on purpose, but she stayed in control of her feelings. She let Connor know that she didn’t like his actions. What did we learn? The On Purpose Plan tells us: If someone plans something to hurt another person’s feelings, this is On Purpose. If someone doesn't plan it, then it was an Accident and we shouldn’t get upset at them.

In this game, we take a look at a situation and help the characters figure out how to act. Reading the room is a tool to help us know what to do in different situations. We always change our behavior based on where we are and what's happening. When we read the room, we pause to: Think about the situation and how you usually act in that situation. Look at everyone in the room. Think about what they're doing and what they have. Make a plan based on what you see. Let's watch Rachel when she needs to change what she's doing based on the situation. Rachel: I hope I can finish my English homework. I have 15 minutes left and... if I keep working, I can get it done. Then I won't have so much to do tonight. I wonder what's wrong with Leah. She's my good friend and it looks like she needs help. I really wanted to get my homework out of the way, but she looks like she really is upset. What do you think is the best action for Rachel to take? She could keep doing her work or she could stop and help her friend. Let's see what she picks. Rachel: Hey, Leah. What's wrong? Leah: I've been trying to figure out this Math problem and it was due last period. If I don't turn it in by the end of the day, I'll be in real trouble. Rachel: Okay. Well, why don't we look at it together? Leah: Thanks so much! I just can't figure it out. Rachel had a plan to finish her own work, but when she read the room, she saw that her friend needed her. She thought about others and figured out how to help a friend in need. Rachel wouldn't have known Leah needed help if she didn't read the room. Rachel was being a great friend. Let's watch Justin decide whether or not to celebrate his accomplishment when he thinks about others. Justin: I can't believe I made the football team! I really didn't think I was going to. I really want to tell everyone. I'm so excited! I could tell Leah. She's not doing anything. Rachel's reading something. She looks busy. I shouldn't bother her. Oh... Zach is here. I heard he didn't make the team. He looks pretty upset. What do you think is the best action for Justin to take? He could tell everyone that he made the team or he could hold it inside. Let's see what he picks. Justin: Zach looks pretty sad. It doesn't seem like the right time to tell everyone. I could see how Zach is doing. Hey man, I heard you didn't make it. Don't worry. There's always next year. You're really good. Zach: Thanks. JV is still really fun. Zach: Yeah, it is. You made it though, right? Congrats! Justin: Thanks! Justin was really excited that he made the team. But after reading the room, he decided it wasn't a good idea to tell everyone. He saw that Zach was upset and he knew he didn't make the team, so Justin decided to hold his good news in. He can still be excited, but he showed his friend empathy and made him feel better. He can always celebrate at home or with other people who made the team. Let's watch Leah decide whether or not to continue a debate about music. Zach: I was talking to my dad this weekend and he said that the music that was around when he was growing up is better than the music now. Rachel: No way! New music is so much better. Justin: Yeah, it's definitely way better now. I don't like old music at all. Leah: I actually think old music is better. I always listen to it with my mom and dad, so I like it more. We're all sharing our opinions, so I can share mine. I think your dad is right. I like old music better. Rachel: I totally disagree. There's so many good new artists now. Justin: I'm with Rachel. I like the new stuff. Zach: Yeah, the new music today is just better. Leah: Well, no one seems to agree with me. They all think music is better now. What do you think is the best action for Leah to take? She could keep disagreeing with the group, or let it go. Let's see what she picks. Leah: I don't think there's any use arguing. People might get upset. I'll just let it go. Well, to each their own. Rachel: We all have our own personal preferences. Leah read the room and decided she didn't want to argue with everyone else. If we have a different opinion than others, we can express our opinion, but we don't need to keep a debate going. People might get upset. Leah did a great job of reading the room and realizing that she didn't need to keep stating her opinion or change anyone else's mind. She said her opinion and left it at that. Reading the room helps us think about other people and their feelings. This in turn helps us know how to act in different situations. All of our characters read the room before making their choices on how to act. That way, their actions didn't make anyone feel upset, annoyed or embarrassed. We watched Rachel observe a friend in need. Justin wait for a better time to celebrate making the football team. And Leah end a debate with a group of people who had different opinions than her. Each character made sure to: Think about the situation and how people usually act in that situation. Look at everyone in the room. Think about what they're doing and what they have. Make a plan based on what they see. Our days are made up of many constantly changing situations. If we read the room before we act, we will know how to adapt our behavior to fit each one. That way, others will have positive thoughts and feelings about us. See you next time! "," - Welcome to Read the Room.

Jackson: Oh, right! Right! Madison: When I see friends, I think about how to act around them. I notice who’s there and look at what everyone’s doing. I can read their mood to try to see how they feel. I noticed the group was talking about phones, so I joined in and made a comment about that topic. I told them about my new phone. I wanted to tell Jackson about my phone too, but when I read his mood, I saw that he looked frustrated and I realized it wasn’t the best time. Being a Social Chameleon will help us know how to act in any situation. Madison was a Social Chameleon when she read both situations and figured out how to act. At first, she noticed what her friends were talking about and joined in. When the situation changed, she tuned in and knew that she had to adjust her actions. Madison read Jackson’s mood to see he was frustrated. She was able to fit into this situation by being helpful to Jackson. This was the best action for the time and place. So, what did we learn? We can be a Social Chameleon by: Tuning into where we are and who is there. Reading People’s Moods – try to see how others are feeling. Adjusting our actions to fit in with the time and place. "," - Being a Social Chameleon means you blend in and adapt to any situation, no matter what’s going on around you. You are able to tune into what’s happening and watch how others are acting.

If you were calling your friend Mike, you could say, “Hi, is Mike there?” Next, think about what you want to say before you call. You might want to make plans, ask a question, or just chat. Also, you should know when to call. You don't want to call too early or too late. This makes people unhappy. Finally, it's best to call one time only. Let's see what happens when Serena breaks these rules. Alessandra: Why did you call me at midnight? Serena: I wanted to tell you about a new show I found. Alessandra: It was way too late and you called me 20 times. My phone kept going off and I couldn't sleep. Serena: Oh, I was awake. What went wrong there? Let's see how Alessandra feels. Alessandra: Serena kept me up all night. I don't want her to call me again. Alessandra feels annoyed. Serena called her too many times and way too late. You shouldn't call people past their bedtime. A good rule is don't call anyone past 9 o'clock, unless it's your parents or an emergency. Let's watch Serena try again. Serena: Okay, what do I need to remember before I call Alessandra? I need to check the time. It's 2:30 in the afternoon, so it's not too late. What else? I'm only going to call once. If she doesn't pick up, I won't call again. She must be busy if she doesn't answer. Last thing, I’ll think about what I want to talk about. I want to tell her about that show I found. I think I'm ready. That time, Serena was ready before she called. She checked the time, remembered to call only once, and she thought of things to talk about. Now she can have a successful phone conversation, and Alessandra won't get annoyed with her.

We do this by noticing how others are acting and imitating them. We don’t copy what people say or exactly how they move. We copy the mood, voice level, behaviors, and rules that the group is following. These are the things that help us blend in while still being ourselves. If we don’t act like Social Chameleons, we can annoy or confuse others by breaking the rules or acting oddly for the situation. Social Chameleons notice people’s behavior and follow the rules of that place to fit in with that group, even if it’s a group of strangers, like at a restaurant or concert. To do this, first Tune In to the surroundings by observing what others are doing. Notice things like noise levels, movements, and what people are doing. Next, we Read People’s Moods. We don’t have to feel what they are feeling, but we do need to copy the overall energy and mood of the people in order to fit in. If everyone is serious and listening, change your body language to be serious and listening. Then, we adjust our actions to fit the Time and Place. Think about how others are acting in this place. What are the rules? We remember to be a Social Chameleon every time we enter a room, new place, or a new group of people. We’re Social Chameleons dozens of times a day! In order to be a Social Chameleon, we can: Tune in and watch how others are acting. Read people’s moods and try to see how others are feeling Adjust our behavior to fit the Time and Place. How you act is based on the rules, where you are, and who is there. Let’s see if Zach can be a Social Chameleon when he enters a new situation. Zach: Sorry, I’m late. I need to match what everyone else is doing. I need an agenda. Liz: So, the next item on the agenda is the list of the order each club will go on stage. Zach: Everyone looks really serious. I thought we were going to just goof around. I need to match the mood. Isaac: I have last year’s list. I can pull it up and see what changes we need to make. Kiara: Is every club and sport represented? Zach: What are the rules of student council? Everyone is expected to contribute. Isaac, could you share last year’s list with everyone? Isaac: Yeah. I can send it right now. Zach: Great, and I'll add the new clubs to the bottom. Liz: Okay! So, the next item on the agenda is the fundraiser. Zach: Looking around and tuning in really helped me know how to act. Sometimes, we’re more relaxed at these meetings and sometimes we really want to get stuff done. Liz: I was worried Zach was going to joke around when he walked in, but he knew that we had to be serious to get everything done. Zach: Every time I walk into any group, room, or situation, I remember to be a Social Chameleon. I imitate other peoples’ mood, behavior, and think about the rules people are following, so I blend into the situation. I would feel embarrassed if I didn’t act in the right way and annoyed everyone. Zach did a great job being a Social Chameleon. He tuned in, thought about everyone’s mood, the time and place, and followed the rules others were following. This helped the group have good thoughts about him. So, what did we learn? In order to be a Social Chameleon, we can: Tune in and watch how others are acting.

It's okay to tell people our opinion, but the way we say it matters. Let's watch Leah try again. Rachel: Did you read Romeo and Juliet yet? I loved it! Leah: Well... It’s not actually my favorite. I know everyone loves it, I just like Hamlet better. Rachel: I haven’t read that one yet. Leah: It’s pretty good. My class read it in the fall. Rachel: When my class gets to it, I’ll tell you how I like it. Leah: Cool! That time Leah changed her tone of voice and the words she used. She spoke in a gentler way rather than sounding so forceful. Leah still expressed her opinions, but she did not offend Rachel or make her feel bad. Next time you want to share an opinion, think about the way your voice sounds. The tone we use can affect the message people get. "," - The way our voice sounds when we talk can change the message our listeners hear. When we have a condescending tone, we're talking down to someone. That means we are acting like we know more than them. If we speak in a condescending tone or sound like we know more about something than others, it will make them feel bad about themselves. We all have a right to express our opinions, but we need to think about the way we say them. Let's watch Leah learn how to use a more gentle tone of voice. Rachel: Have you read Romeo and Juliet yet? I loved it! Leah: Ugh! I don’t get why people love it so much. It's so boring. Rachel: Oh. Well... I liked it. Leah: Actually, real Shakespeare fans say Hamlet is way better. Rachel: Oh, okay. Whatever you say. How did Leah express her opinion? How did she make Rachel feel? Let's see. Rachel: Leah always talks like she's better than me. She must think that she knows more than me. I don’t think I’ll be asking for her opinion again. Leah made Rachel feel upset by using a condescending tone of voice. She made Rachel feel like she was talking down to her or knew more than her because of the words she used and the way she said them.

Is the main character using direct language or indirect language? Are they saying exactly what they mean or talking around it?",Direct and Indirect Language,,,,A29,https://everydayspeechsocialskillsvideos.vhx.tv/videos/two-sides-direct-indirect-language,https://res.cloudinary.com/everyday-speech/raw/upload/v1619184980/SubtitlesVTT/PLllHMXikJ_A029_Two_Sides_-_Direct_Indirect_Language.vtt," - Welcome to Two Sides, a game where we compare how people act in different situations. In this video, we're going to compare Direct Language and Indirect Language. Using Indirect Language means we talk around something without actually saying it directly. We might use indirect language when we correct someone or tell them bad news. When we use Direct Language, we say exactly what we're thinking. Sometimes using too direct language can upset other people, but sometimes it's necessary to get your point across. When we're talking with people, we want to try to figure out when we should use direct language and when we should use indirect language. Think about if the person you're talking to will get upset if you use direct language. Would it be better to use indirect language? Every time we see this icon in the corner, we should stop and discuss what happened. Let's get started. In this scene, Zach and Justin are talking about homework when Leah has something to say. Let's see if Leah uses direct or indirect language. Zach: Do you know what the Math homework was? Justin: I'm pretty sure it's all the even questions at the end of chapter 4. Leah: Are you sure? I thought we are working on chapter 5. I could be wrong. Justin: Oh, maybe. I might have gotten the chapters confused. Leah: Yeah. I'm pretty sure it's chapter 5. I'll ask though. Justin: Oh, no, you're probably right. Zach: Thanks! Did Leah directly or indirectly correct Justin? Leah indirectly corrected Justin. Leah wanted to correct Justin, but she didn't want to directly tell him he was wrong. She made sure to phrase it as a question. Leah: Are you sure? I thought we are working on chapter 5. She also made sure to tell Justin she might be wrong. This made her correction a bit softer. Oftentimes, people don't like to be directly corrected about something. Why do you think that is? How does it make them feel? In this scene, Zach and Justin are talking about homework when Leah has something to say. Let's see if Leah uses direct or indirect language. Zach: Do you remember what the Math homework was? Justin: I'm pretty sure it's all the even questions at the end of chapter 4. Leah: No, you're definitely wrong. It's chapter 5! We already did chapter 4. Justin: Okay. Alright then. Zach: Thanks. Did Leah directly or indirectly correct Justin? Leah directly corrected Justin. Leah told Justin he was wrong and then told Zach the correct chapter to work on. Leah: No, you're definitely wrong. It's chapter 5. We already did chapter 4. When she told Justin he was definitely wrong, he seemed upset. Justin: Okay. Alright then. Leah could still get her message across without being so direct. She didn't have to tell Justin he was definitely wrong. There was a way she could have been less direct, and still made sure that Zach knew the right chapters for homework. In this case, being direct made Justin feel annoyed. In this scene, Jack is talking to Connor about a movie he's going to see. Let's focus on Connor and see if he uses direct or indirect language. Connor: Paul mentioned you guys are hanging out this weekend. Jack: Yeah. We're going to go see that new Star Wars movie. Connor: I love those! Can I come with you? Jack: Sure! Connor: Where are you guys going? Jack: The AMC Theater in town. Connor: I live right by there. I can even walk! Jack: Awesome! Was Connor using direct language or indirect language? Connor was using direct language. Connor felt comfortable enough with Jack that he could just ask if he could come along. If it were someone he didn't know as well, he might not have asked directly and waited to be asked instead. Think about when you should ask for things directly or indirectly. Let's watch them talk about the movies again and see the difference between asking directly and indirectly. Connor: Paul mentioned you guys are hanging out this weekend. Jack: Yeah. We're going to go see that new Star Wars movie. Connor: I love those! I've seen them all so far. Jack: Yeah. They look pretty good. Connor: Where are you guys going? Jack: The AMC Theater in town. Connor: Oh, really? I live right near there. I can even walk. Jack: Connor keeps mentioning the movie and the movie theater. He's not asking to come, but his comments make me think he wants to come. I should check and see if he wants to come. Do you want to come with us? Connor: Yeah! That'd be so much fun! Jack: Okay. We're going to leave at 5:00 on Sunday. Connor: Awesome! See you there! Was Connor using direct language or indirect language? Connor was using indirect language. Connor was hinting that he wanted to go to the movie. How do we know? He said he loves Star Wars, telling Jack he's really interested in them. Connor: I love those! I've seen them all so far. He also told Jack how close he live to the movie theater, and how easy it would be for him to get there. Connor: I live right near there. I can even walk. Connor didn't want to directly ask Jack if he could go to the movies. He was hinting at it, hoping that Jack would ask him. Jack did a great job of picking up on Connor's indirect language and figuring out what Connor wanted. Why might Connor not want to ask Jack directly if he could go to the movies with them? In this scene, Leah and Justin are talking about a test Justin just took. Does Justin use direct or indirect language? Leah: How'd the History test go? Justin: Well, it was 25 multiple choice, a fill in map, and three essays. It took me up to the bell to finish it. Piece of cake. Leah: Yikes! That's rough. Did Justin used direct or indirect language? Justin used indirect language. Sarcasm is one of the most common uses of indirect language. We say the opposite of what we actually mean to be funny or to make a point. How can we tell Justin was being sarcastic? First, he described a pretty difficult test and said it took him the entire class. Justin: It was 25 multiple choice, a fill in map, and three essays. It took me up to the bell to finish it. Then he said the opposite of that when he said ""piece of cake."" Justin: Piece of cake. Leah: Yikes! That's rough. His tone of voice also changed. These were all clues to Leah that he was being sarcastic and that the test was actually hard. Let's see another way Justin and Leah could have talked about the test. This time, does Justin use direct or indirect language? Leah: How's the History test go? Justin: Well, it was 25 multiple choice, a fill in map, and three essay questions. It took me up to the bell to finish. It was so hard. Leah: Yikes! That's rough. Did Justin use direct or indirect language? Justin used direct language. Justin wasn't sarcastic at all. He said exactly what he meant. The words he said matched the message he was trying to send. He described a hard test and said it was hard. Justin: It was so hard! Leah: Yikes! He wasn't smiling and his voice didn't change in tone. He said exactly what he meant. Great job, everyone! We learned a lot about using direct and indirect language today. We can use indirect language when we correct others. Leah: Are you sure? I thought we are working on chapter 5. I could be wrong. Or want to be invited without asking if you can come. Connor: I love those! I've seen them all so far. We can use direct language when we are serious and want to get our point across. Justin: It was so hard! Leah: Yikes! Or if we're really good friends with someone. Think about the message you want to send and how you can get someone else to better understand you. Should you be direct or indirect? See you next time!

When we tell a story, we need to give all the background information. If we leave anything out, people could be confused. When we're talking to others, we need to make sure we tell them Who we are talking about What happened Where we went When it happened For each video, we'll listen to the story being told and decide if any information is missing. Pay attention to how successful the character's story is to help you figure out if anything is missing. Let's get started. Listen to Zach's story and see if any background information is missing. Zach: This weekend, I went to Christo's. Me and my family go every Friday. It's so much fun. You should go! Leah: Christo's? Zach: Yup! Every Friday. Did Zach tell Leah every piece of background information? Let's listen again. Zach: This weekend, I went to Christo's. Me and my family go every Friday. It's so much fun. You should go! Leah: Christo's? Zach: Yup! Every Friday. Which part did Zach leave out? He left out the what. Let's see how this made Leah feel. Leah: What does he do on Fridays? I've never heard of Christo's, so I'm not sure what he means. Leah felt confused because Zach didn't tell her what he was talking about. He told her he went to Christo's, but from Leah's reaction, we can tell she doesn't know what he did there. Zach should have told her what kind of place that is. Let's watch what happens when he does tell her what he did. Zach: This weekend, I got pizza at Christo's. Me and my family go every Friday. It's so much fun. You should go! Leah: So they have good pizza? Zach: Yup! And they have fun arcade games. It's so cool! That time, Zach gave all of the information in his story. He included the who, what, where, and when. Zach: This weekend, I got pizza at Christo's. Me and my family go every Friday. It's so much fun. You should go! This time, no one was confused. Listen to Leah's story and see if any background information is missing. Leah: Yesterday, I went to Brooke's Farm to get ice cream with my sister. That place is the best! Rachel: I love it there! What flavor did you get? Leah: I got Cookies and Cream. It was so good! Rachel: Yum! I love their sundaes. Did Leah tell Rachel every piece of background information? Let's listen again. Leah: Yesterday, I went to Brooke's Farm to get ice cream with my sister. That place is the best! Rachel: I love it there! What flavor did you get? Leah: I got Cookies and Cream. It was so good! Rachel: Yum! I love their sundaes. How did this conversation make Rachel feel? Was she confused? Rachel: I love Brooke's Farm, just like Leah. I should ask her to go with me sometime. Which part did Leah leave out? Leah didn't leave anything out. She included the entire background brief in her story. She included the who, what, where, and when. Leah: Yesterday, I went to Brooke's Farm to get ice cream with my sister. That place is the best! Remember to include all of the background information anytime you tell someone a story. Listen to Zach's story and see if any background information is missing. Zach: We both went to the mall on Saturday to buy sneakers. We found some really good sales. Leah: You did? Zach: Yeah! I bought some cool new sneakers. Did Zach tell Leah every piece of background information? Let's listen again. Zach: We both went to the mall on Saturday to buy sneakers. We found some really good sales. Leah: You did? Zach: Yeah! I bought some cool new sneakers. Which part did Zach leave out? He left out the who. Let's see how this made Leah feel. Leah: Who went to the mall? He never said. Leah felt confused because Zach didn't tell her who he was talking about. He just said 'we' so Leah doesn't know who that could be. Let's watch what happens when he does tell her who he was with. Zach: My friend, Carter, and I went to the mall on Saturday to buy sneakers. We both found some really good deals. Leah: Cool! What store did you go to? Zach: Zumiez. I got some really cool ones. That time, Zach gave all of the information in his story. He included the who, what, where, and when. Zach: My friend, Carter, and I went to the mall on Saturday to buy sneakers. Now Leah was able to understand his story. We just saw a few examples of successful and not so successful storytelling. When we talk to others, remember the background brief. All of the background information we need to include so we don't make others feel confused. In order for everyone to understand your story, you should include: Who you are talking about, What happened, Where you went, When it happened.

Why do we show others respect?,Showing Respect,,,,,,https://res.cloudinary.com/everyday-speech/raw/upload/v1619186996/SubtitlesVTT/SEL17_Showing_Respect.vtt," Respect is treating others in a way that makes them feel valued. We show respect in our words, behavior, and habits. Disrespect and put-downs are often used as jokes to make others laugh. Because we hear disrespectful words so often in shows and videos, we can be confused between jokes and disrespect. Let’s think about what respectful and disrespectful language sounds like. We are going to call respectful language Put-Ups and disrespectful language Put-Downs. A put-up isn’t just a compliment. It’s anything that makes someone feel valuable. For example, “Thanks for the ride” is a put-up. It shows you understand someone did something nice for you. Here are some examples of Put-ups: Good idea. What do you think? Do you want to go first? Pause here to discuss why these are put-ups. Can you think of others? Put-downs make someone feel less valued or less important. Some of these might be things you say all the time, but didn’t know they were disrespectful. That’s okay. Becoming aware of our words is what we’re learning today. Name why these are put-downs, or disrespectful language: So what? Who cares? Not my problem. Do it yourself. Whatever. Why should I care? Did I ask you? Teachers, you can pause here to discuss this list with your students. Our behavior also shows our respect for others. Disrespectful behavior are things like cutting in line, not including others, taking someone’s things, or not waiting our turn. Teachers, pause here to discuss these actions. Brainstorm more disrespectful behaviors and talk about how they make others feel. Respectful behavior is holding the door, raising your hand, doing the work you’re given, and answering people’s questions. Teachers, pause here to discuss these actions. Brainstorm more respectful behaviors and talk about how they make others feel. Respectful habits are things you do automatically to show others respect every time you’re in that situation. They are habits like saying please and thank you, taking shoes off at a door, taking dishes to a sink, or introducing people who haven’t met each other yet. What are some respectful habits you do every day? Why are these important? As you become a more respectful class, your teacher will lead you in new ways. Your teacher may make new rules, such as a tally on the board for respectful and disrespectful comments. Your teacher may come up with a class buzz word for disrespectful comments such as “ouch” and your teacher might even require one put-up for each put-down. Starting with a tally is a good way to help the class become more aware of their words and behaviors. DISCUSSION: What are ways your class is respectful? Without mentioning names, what are ways your class is disrespectful? Make a list of new rules for improving respect in the class. "," Respect is treating others in a way that makes them feel valued.

We call this using a Closed Mind. A Closed Mind is when we only like our own ideas and our own ways and won’t let in other people’s ideas. A Closed Mind isn’t very good for us because it makes us feel worried and upset. If we have a Closed Mind when we hang out with friends, they might not have fun playing with us. The opposite of a Closed Mind is an Open Mind. We stay calm so we can let in a new idea. If our minds feel stuck on an old idea, we pick a calming strategy and tell ourselves it’s okay to try new things. Then, we picture the new idea, see that we’ll stay safe doing something the new way, and agree to try it. We might say something like, “Okay, I’ll try that.” We usually get more and more comfortable every time we use our Open Minds, until it’s easy for us to do! When we use our Open Mind, we: Pick a calming strategy. Open Minds think best when we’re calm. Use Self-talk, telling yourself, “I can try new things.” Use your Open Mind to picture yourself doing the new way in your head. Agree to try it. Let’s see what using an Open Mind looks like.

Maya was annoyed that Andy didn’t keep an open mind. Friends don’t like being told what to do. Andy didn’t think about Maya’s feelings. He only thought of the game he wanted to play and didn’t think about her feelings. This wasn’t very fun for Maya. Let’s watch him try to keep an Open Mind. Maya: So what should we play? Andy: How about Race Against Time! Maya: We always play that. Andy: But... that’s my favorite. Maya: We don’t always have to play the same game. Andy: Oh no! I don’t want to play a new game, but I feel like I’m getting upset. This is a good time to try an Open Mind. First, I’ll take deep breaths. Now, I’ll picture it her way. If we play another game, I guess it won’t be any different. I guess I can try it. Andy: Okay, well, what do you want to play? Maya: Can we play checkers? Andy: Sure! Maya: I’m glad Andy agreed to play something new. We had a lot of fun! Andy: Having an Open Mind helps me in situations that I'd normally be upset about. It's a lot more fun when I’m willing to make small changes. Keeping an Open Mind helped Andy have fun even when Maya made the choices. Maya had fun playing with Andy too, and she will probably want to play with him again. It helps everyone have fun when we keep an open mind. When we use our Open Mind, we: Pick a calming strategy. Open Minds think best when we’re calm. Use Self-talk, telling yourself, “I can try new things.” Use your Open Mind to picture yourself doing the new way in your head. Agree to try it. "," - It can be hard to deal with change or when others don’t share our ideas or want to do things our way. We call this using a Closed Mind. A Closed Mind is when we only like our own ideas and our own ways and won’t let in other people’s ideas. A Closed Mind isn’t very good for us because it makes us feel worried and upset. If we have a Closed Mind when we hang out with friends, they might not have fun playing with us. The opposite of a Closed Mind is an Open Mind. We stay calm so we can let in a new idea. If our minds feel stuck on an old idea, we pick a calming strategy and tell ourselves it’s okay to try new things. Then, we picture the new idea, see that we’ll stay safe doing something the new way, and agree to try it. We might say something like, “Okay, I’ll try that.” We usually get more and more comfortable every time we use our Open Minds, until it’s easy for us to do!

SEL,Showing Gratitude,SEL08,https://slp.everydayspeech.com/video/showing-gratitude,2,2-3,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,Aug-20,,TEACHER SCRIPT: Today we’re going to talk about the concept of gratitude. Who can define what the word ‘gratitude’ means? Can anyone give an example of what showing gratitude looks like?,Showing Respect,,,,,,https://res.cloudinary.com/everyday-speech/raw/upload/v1619186995/SubtitlesVTT/SEL08_Showing_Gratitude.vtt," Research has shown that being grateful is a habit that leads to the most happiness and success. Gratitude makes us more social and leads us into healthier, happier activities. Whatever goals we make, being more grateful in our daily lives should certainly be one of them. There are four main ways to become more grateful in our lives. We can take a few minutes of quiet time each day to reflect on all the things and people we are grateful for. You can do this as you wake up, before you go to bed, and before each meal. We can say thank you to someone in our family or life once a week. This can be a text, email, or note. Think of someone who was nice to you. Show your gratitude by doing something nice for them. Look for opportunities to do kind deeds for someone you don’t ‘owe,’ like an acquaintance. Teachers, you can pause here to discuss this with your students. Gratefulness is like a fertilizer that helps us grow much faster. It is a practice that motivates us to improve our own lives and the lives of others. How does it do this? Gratefulness connects us to others. The greater our connections to others, the more we succeed. For example, when we thank a sibling, we create a stronger bond with that sibling in a way that lasts beyond that moment. Gratefulness makes us humble. It removes the focus from ourselves and helps us recognize that our success is because many people helped us along the way. Once we recognize this, we then start to think about who we can help, too. Gratefulness gives us lasting happiness. Gratefulness spreads happiness to others and when we do this, we receive even greater happiness. Gratefulness improves patience. Patient people are more successful in their lives because they regularly take the time to think about others and make good decisions. DISCUSSION: To practice being grateful: Name 3 things you are grateful for. Name 3 people who help you. How will you thank these 3 people this week? Who can you help today? Is there a set time every day you can dedicate 1 minute to gratitude? "," Research has shown that being grateful is a habit that leads to the most happiness and success.

In this video, we’re going to try to figure out how people are going to react to different situations. After each video, we’ll give you three choices. You have to guess which one is going to happen. This video is all about Body Language. That means focusing on how people’s bodies and faces look, and how their voice sounds. Those could be big clues to tell how someone is feeling. Whenever we see this icon in the corner, we can stop and talk about the situation. Let’s get started! Let’s focus on Serena. She’s going to give Alessandra a birthday present. Focus on her body language when Alessandra tells her what she thinks of the gift. Liz: Your birthday this weekend was awesome! Serena: Oh, I'm sorry I couldn’t make it, but I got you a gift! Alessandra: I don’t even like this color! I don’t want it. How did Serena’s body change after Alessandra told her she didn’t like the gift? What do you think Serena will think next? Serena will think... That Alessandra hurt her feelings. It was her fault for picking the wrong color. She will have to get Alessandra a new gift. Let’s see what Serena was thinking. Serena: I can’t believe she yelled at me like that. She really hurt my feelings. I don’t want to hang out with her anymore. Serena doesn’t want to hang out with Alessandra anymore. Alessandra hurt her feelings when she told Serena she didn’t like the gift. When Alessandra gave the gift back, Serena slowly took it away. And she put her hand on her chin and looked sad. All these clues add up to tell us that Serena was upset by what Alessandra did. If we make friends upset, they may not want to hang out with us anymore. Even though Alessandra didn’t like the gift, what’s something else she could have said to Serena? For this video, we’re going to focus on Kate. How do we think she’s feeling after a disagreement with Mike? Mike: Hey Kate, come look at this drawing I made. Aww! Kate: Sorry. Mike: What did you do that for? These are my favorite shoes. Kate: Jeez, chill out! It was an accident. Mike: It doesn't matter. Don't touch my sneakers! Focus on Kate’s body language. What is Kate’s body and face telling you about how she feels? After Mike yells at Kate, she has some thoughts. What do you think she will be thinking? Kate will think... Mike was overreacting and she doesn’t like it. It was all her fault for stepping on his sneakers. Mike is a helpful friend. Let's see. Kate: It was just an accident. I barely touched his sneakers. Kate thinks Mike is overreacting. How can we tell from her body language? Kate’s voice sounded like she thought Mike shouldn’t be yelling at her. Kate: Jeez, chill out! It was an accident. She rolled her eyes and she stopped making eye contact with him. These are all clues that help us understand that Kate doesn’t like what Mike is saying to her. She thinks he had a big reaction to a small problem. In this video, we’re going to focus on Graham and Nick. They just got their grades for their history tests. Let’s take a look at how Nick’s reaction changes when he sees Graham’s body language. Nick: I just got an A on my history midterm! It was so hard, I can’t believe it! Graham: Oh, that’s great. What do you think Nick is going to say next? Why? Nick will say... “I did so great on the test!” “I was really worried about the test.” “You sound upset. What’s wrong?” Let's see what happens next. Nick: Hey, you sound upset. What's wrong? Graham: I didn’t do so good. Nick: Hey, I’m sorry man. It was a really hard test. Don’t worry about it. Nick asked Graham what was wrong. How could he tell that Graham wasn’t feeling very happy? Graham had his head in his hand. Graham was looking at the ground. And Graham’s voice didn’t sound very excited. Graham: Oh, that’s great. Nick read the clues and figured out that Graham was upset about something. He asked Graham what was wrong. Then, he made Graham feel better by telling him it was a difficult test and not to worry about it. Nick did a great job adjusting his words and tone of voice once he found out that Graham was upset. How would Graham had felt if Nick kept talking about his good grade in an excited voice? The group is playing a game and Serena isn’t winning. Let’s see what Alessandra, Andrew, and Devin’s body language tells us about how they are feeling after Serena’s turn. Devin: Okay, Andrew, it’s your turn. Andrew: Yes! Six! I’m so far ahead! Serena: It’s my turn. I rolled a two last time! I don’t want to play this stupid game anymore! How do you think the rest of the group felt after Serena left? They felt sad that the game is over. Happy that they are winning. Confused and upset at her reaction. Let’s see what Andrew and Devin are thinking. Andrew: Why did she knock everything over? It’s just a game. Devin: We were just having fun. Next time, I’m not going to play with her. The group is confused and upset by Serena’s actions. How could we tell they are feeling confused? They raised their hands as if they didn’t understand what was happening, and they looked at each other with confused looks on their faces. Their eyebrows were scrunched down and their eyes were slightly closed. We can tell that they are also upset because they all sighed and looked at the ruined game board. The group didn’t expect Serena to act that way just because she was losing the game. We can’t win every time, but even if we don’t win, we’re still expected to be a good sport. This time, we’re going to focus on Mike. He has a small accident in front of his friends. Let’s focus on his reaction to see how that makes him feel. Mike: What a klutz! Jeff: Walk much? Mike tripped in front of his friends. How does he feel after he tripped? Mike feels... really upset. Silly but okay Confused Let’s see what happens next! Mike: I can't believe I tripped in the middle of the hall. At least only my friends saw it. Mike feels silly for tripping, but he’s okay and not upset. So it’s okay that his friends joined in the laughter. They weren’t being mean. How could we tell how he was feeling? Mike was laughing. And he had a smile on his face. How would his body language have been different if he was really hurt when he fell? This time, we’ll look at Liz and Alessandra. Alessandra is telling Liz about her favorite movie. Alessandra: I want to watch Frozen again. It’s my favorite movie. Liz: Yeah, I really like it too. Alessandra: Elsa is my favorite. But, I also like Olaf. He’s so funny! What message is Liz’s body language sending to Alessandra? I’m not listening to you. I care about what you have to say. I like that movie too. Let’s see how Alessandra reacts. Alessandra: Uh, did you hear what I said? Liz’s body language sent Alessandra a message that she wasn’t listening to what Alessandra was saying. Liz was facing away from Alessandra, kept her eyes and head down, and didn’t look at her. That sent Alessandra the message that Liz wasn’t listening. That made Alessandra confused. What are three ways Liz could show Alessandra that she is listening? In this video, Mike is having a bad day. Let’s see what message Sarah and Jeff’s body language sends to him. Mike: Man, I'm having the worst day. Sarah: Oh no, I'm sorry. Jeff: I'm sorry to hear that. What's wrong? Mike: Well, first I forgot my homework at home, and then I spilled water in my bag. Jeff: Man, that's rough. Sarah: I bet you can clean it out. What do you think Mike will think next? Think about Sarah and Jeff’s facial expressions, tone of voice, and where they moved their bodies. What message did that send? Will Mike think... Sarah and Jeff are bored. Sarah and Jeff care about his feelings. That his whole day is ruined. Let’s see. Mike: I was having a bad day but my friends made me feel much better. Sarah and Jeff are good friends. Mike thought Sarah and Jeff cared about his feelings. Mike’s friends made him feel better. They used a sincere tone of voice. It sounded like they really felt bad for Mike. Sarah: Oh no, I’m sorry. Jeff: I’m sorry to hear that. What’s wrong? They moved their bodies towards Mike and looked at him to show they are listening. And their faces looked interested in what Mike had to say. By listening to Mike and showing him they understood what he was going through, they made him feel a little bit better. Sarah, Mike, and Jeff are sitting around talking about summer vacation. Sarah has a lot to say about her birthday. Let’s focus on Jeff and Mike’s body language to see how they are feeling. Mike: Are you guys excited for summer? Sarah: Yeah! My birthday is in July. Mike: Oh, cool! I can't wait to go to the beach. Sarah: We always have a party and then we go to the movies. Mike: Cool! I love going to the beach. I love boogie boarding. Sarah: I wonder what my present will be. I asked for an iPad this year. I hope I get it. Jeff: What beach do you go to? Mike: I go to Mayflower Beach. Sarah: What do you guys think I'll get for my birthday? What do you think will happen next? Will Mike and Jeff... Tell Sarah what her birthday present will be. Yell at Sarah. Stop having a conversation with Sarah. Hmm... let's see. Jeff: I'm not sure. But I got to go. Bye! Mike: Me too. See ya. Mike and Jeff decided to end the conversation and leave. They were not interested in talking about Sarah’s birthday anymore. How do we know? When Sarah keeps bringing up her birthday, Mike and Jeff have confused looks on their faces. Mike and Jeff also turned their bodies to face each other, and not Sarah. These are clues that can show they aren’t interested in talking about Sarah’s birthday anymore. Can you name a time where something was important to you but not so important to other people? Was it hard not to talk about it? Great job, everyone! We went over a lot of different types of body language today. Remember to think about someone’s tone of voice... Kate: Jeez. Chill out! It was an accident. Their facial expression and where they are facing their eyes and body. All of these things can give you clues about how someone is feeling. See you next time! "," - Welcome to Guess What Happens Next. In this video, we’re going to try to figure out how people are going to react to different situations. After each video, we’ll give you three choices. You have to guess which one is going to happen. This video is all about Body Language. That means focusing on how people’s bodies and faces look, and how their voice sounds. Those could be big clues to tell how someone is feeling. Whenever we see this icon in the corner, we can stop and talk about the situation. Let’s get started! Let’s focus on Serena. She’s going to give Alessandra a birthday present. Focus on her body language when Alessandra tells her what she thinks of the gift. Liz: Your birthday this weekend was awesome! Serena: Oh, I'm sorry I couldn’t make it, but I got you a gift! Alessandra: I don’t even like this color! I don’t want it. How did Serena’s body change after Alessandra told her she didn’t like the gift? What do you think Serena will think next? Serena will think... That Alessandra hurt her feelings. It was her fault for picking the wrong color. She will have to get Alessandra a new gift. Let’s see what Serena was thinking. Serena: I can’t believe she yelled at me like that. She really hurt my feelings. I don’t want to hang out with her anymore. Serena doesn’t want to hang out with Alessandra anymore. Alessandra hurt her feelings when she told Serena she didn’t like the gift. When Alessandra gave the gift back, Serena slowly took it away. And she put her hand on her",0.009723992006

How is she feeling about her class presentation today? Matt: Good luck on your presentation today! Christine: Thanks! It's my first time speaking in front of the whole class. Matt: I'm sure it will go great. Have you been practicing? Christine: I practiced all last night. I just don't want to mess up. How do you think Christine was feeling? Christine was... nervous. Christine was nervous because she’s never spoken in front of the class before. Christine: It's my first time speaking in front of the whole class. She was wringing her hands and rubbing her legs, which can be a sign that someone is nervous. Find 'Nervous' on your board, and mark it! We’re going to focus on Kate. How is she feeling when Serena has bad news for her? Kate: I let you borrow my Math book last week. Can I have it back now? Serena: Uh... actually, I lost it. Kate: What?! Serena: I can't find it anywhere! Kate: You should have told me! Uh-oh. How is Kate feeling? Kate was... angry. When Kate responded to Serena, her voice got louder, and the tone changed.

We need four players to play! How do you think Alessandra was feeling there? Alessandra was feeling... awkward. After Chris yelled, Alessandra was looking around the room because she wasn’t sure what to do. When people feel awkward, they are a little embarrassed or uncomfortable. When Chris yelled at Bobby because of Alessandra, this put Alessandra in an awkward position. Find 'Awkward' on your board, and mark it! This time, we’ll focus on Liz. She has some plans for New Year’s eve. Matt: So, what are you guys doing for New Year's? Liz: I'm going to First Night. Josh: First night is so boring! Liz: My family and I go every year. Josh: Why? I hate First Night. Liz: Well, that's your opinion! That wasn’t very nice of Josh. How did that make Liz feel? Liz was... offended. Her mouth was open, as if she was shocked by what Josh had to say. Josh was very rigid with his thinking. He doesn’t like First Night, and he didn’t understand that other people can have different opinions than him. Liz gave Josh a clue that First Night is important to her when she said she goes every year. Liz: My family and I go every year. Find 'Offended' on your board, and mark it! Let’s focus on Tyler. How is he feeling about Alessandra’s idea for their project? Alessandra: I was thinking, for our community service project, we could do a food drive. Tyler: That's an awesome idea!

Let’s focus on how Tim feels when the group makes a plan. Alessandra: What should we do? Any ideas? Mike: Hmm... we could play cards. Alessandra: That's a good idea! What game? Ryan: How about Go Fish? Mike: Yeah, that sounds fun! Alessandra: Alright, let's go! Tim: But... I wanted to play too! Nobody in this class likes me. How was Tim feeling? Tim was feeling... lonely. When the rest of the group made a plan and didn’t include him, Tim was sad because he was left out. Next time, the rest of the group should try to include Tim. That would be the nice thing to do. Find 'Lonely' on your board, and mark it! Mike isn’t having a great day. How do Sarah and Jeff feel? Mike: Man, I'm having the worst day. Sarah: Oh, no. I'm sorry. Jeff: I'm sorry to hear that. What's wrong? Mike: Well, first I forgot my homework at home and then I spilled water in my bag. Jeff: Man, that's rough. Sarah: I bet you can clean it out. What did Sarah and Jeff’s bodies tell you? What were they feeling? Sarah and Jeff were... concerned. When Mike was telling them about his bad day, they leaned in closer to him, which showed they cared about how he was feeling. And they had sincere tones of voice. Jeff: Man, that’s rough. Sarah: I bet you can clean it out. When we’re concerned, we care about the other person’s situation and want to try to make it better. Find 'Concerned' on your board, and mark it! Someone left a mess in the classroom. How is Mike feeling about it? Kate: Hey, Mike. What was that YouTube video you were telling us about? Mike: Oh, it's so funny! Kate: Oh, that's cool! Come show us! Teacher: Who forgot to clean up their work from the table? We can't leave the classroom messy like that. Mike: Oh no! I left that stuff on the table! I didn't do it on purpose. But it was still my fault, so I should say something. I did it. I'm sorry. It was an accident. I can go clean it up. Teacher: Thank you, Mike. Why don't you go clean it up. What did Mike’s words and eyes tell you? Mike was feeling... guilty. Feeling guilty means we feel bad about something. Mike knew he made the mess, so he wanted to take responsibility. Mike was looking at the ground and had his shoulders slumped. This can be a sign that someone is feeling bad about something. Mike probably felt a lot better after he took responsibility. Find 'Guilty' on your board, and mark it! Let’s focus on Tyler when he can’t find his phone. Tyler: Has anyone seen my phone? I can't find it anywhere! Alessandra: Is this it? Tyler: Yes! Thank you so much! I must have left it here earlier. That would have been really bad. Alessandra: It's no problem. How do you think Tyler was feeling when he found his phone? Tyler was... relieved. He felt nervous about his phone and then happy when he found it. We feel relief when a problem that was stressful gets solved. Tyler: Thank you so much! I must have left it here earlier. That would have been really bad. Alessandra: It's no problem. Find 'Relieved' on your board, and mark it! For our final round, let’s focus on Serena. Mike: Hey, how are you feeling about the recital tonight? Serena: Really good.

We’ll give you the scenario to role play, and let you know how each character is feeling. The rest of the group can rate the actors based on their performance. How did their actions match up with the emotions they were supposed to feel? After the role play is finished, we’ll show this icon and we can discuss how everyone is feeling. What happened in the scene? Did emotions change from the beginning of the scene to the end? Let’s get started! In this scenario, Liz wants to talk to Josh but isn’t sure what to talk about with him. She notices he’s reading a book she’s read and wants to talk to him about that. While you’re watching, think about how you can Use Clues to come up with topics to talk about. Liz: I want to talk to Josh, but I don't know what to talk about with him. I've read that book before. I can talk to him about that. I love that book. Have you seen the movie? Josh: I'm waiting to finish the book before I see it. Liz: I think the book is better, but everyone always says that. Josh: Well, I'm really enjoying the book so far. Now get ready to role play! Choose who is going to be Person A and Person B. Remember the Scenario: Person A notices a clue about person B and starts to talk to them about it. You can use our clue of a book, or come up with your own. Person B is excited to talk about their interest. Now it's time to rate the role playing. How did it go? Let’s rate Person A. How did they start the conversation about the clue? Were they able to keep the conversation going? What would you give them out of five stars? How about Person B? Did they sound excited to talk about the topic? How did they keep the conversation going? What would you give them out of five stars? Nice job! In this scenario, Tyler wants to tell Serena about the hockey game last night. Serena isn’t interested in hockey. While you’re watching, think about how Serena is showing that she isn’t interested.

It went to a shootout. Serena: Sounds exciting. Tyler: Yeah. Hockey is the greatest. You really should have seen it. Serena: Mm-hmm. Now get ready to role play! Choose who is going to be Person A and Person B. Remember the Scenario: Person A wants to talk to Person B. You keep talking even though the other person isn’t interested. You can talk about hockey or choose your own topic. Person B isn’t interested in the topic, and shows it with their words and body language. Now it's time to rate the role playing. How did it go? Let’s rate Person A. Did they sound like they cared about the topic? Did they keep talking even though the other person wasn’t interested? What would you give them out of five stars? How about Person B? Did their words show they weren’t interested? Did their body language and tone show they weren’t interested? What would you give them out of five stars? Nice job role playing! In this scene, Alessandra and Serena are having a casual conversation about their homework. When that conversation is over, they start talking about their weekend plans. While you’re watching, think about how they shift the topic. How did Serena know it was the right time? Serena: Didn't you think the Spanish homework was hard? It took me a long time. Alessandra: I had trouble with it too. The vocab was so tough. Serena: I know, right? So, what are you up to this weekend? Alessandra: I'm going outing with my family on Saturday and then just hang in on Sunday. You? Serena: Nothing big planned. I was hoping to go to the movies. Alessandra: Cool!

What would you give them out of five stars? Great job! In this scene, Mike and Tyler are talking about movies when Tyler doesn’t connect his comments. Mike wants to talk more about movies, but Tyler talks about video games. While you’re watching, think about how not connecting comments can make people feel. Mike: Seen any good movies lately? Tyler: I saw the Superman movie. I like that. Mike: I haven't heard about that. What's it about? Tyler: Which do you like better, Xbox or Playstation? Mike: Uhm... Playstation, I guess. So, what's the Superman movie about? Tyler: I used to like Xbox better. But now I like Playstation better. Mike: Okay? Now get ready to role play! Choose who is going to be Person A and Person B.

What would you give them out of five stars? How about Person B? Did they sound confused when they heard the unconnected comment? Did they keep trying to talk about the first topic? What would you give them out of five stars? In this scene, Mike and Serena are talking about going to New York city. Mike really likes New York and keeps bragging about how many times he’s been. Serena starts to get annoyed that Mike keeps talking about himself. While you’re watching, think about how only talking about yourself makes other people feel. Mike: Hey, have you ever been to New York City? Serena: Yeah, I have actually. Mike: Well, I have been three times. Serena: Wow, that's cool! Mike: Yeah. One time we stayed right next to Times Square. Serena: Sounds fun. Mike: I've been to the top of the Empire State Building. Serena: Nice. Mike: I've probably been more times than anybody else in the school. Serena: Probably. Um... now I need to finish this. Okay? Mike: Okay. Now get ready to role play! Choose who is going to be Person A and Person B. Remember the Scenario: Person A and Person B are talking about New York. Person A keeps talking about themselves and how many times they’ve been there. Person B starts to get annoyed and doesn’t want to talk about New York anymore. If you don’t know about New York, choose your own topic! Now it's time to rate the role playing. How did it go? Let’s rate Person A. Did they keep talking about themselves? Did they sound like they were bragging? What would you give them out of five stars? How about Person B? How did their tone of voice and body language change from the beginning to the end? What clues did they give that they were annoyed? What would you give them out of five stars? Nice job with our role plays! The topics we decide to talk about can have a big impact on how other people think of us! We learned… What happens when we don’t connect comments... Mike: Uhm... Playstation, I guess. So, what's the Superman movie about? Tyler: I used to like Xbox better but now I like Playstation better. Mike: Okay? How we can use clues to pick topics others are interested in... Liz: I love that book. Have you seen the movie? Josh: I'm waiting to finish the book before I see it. And how to stay on one topic until it is a good time to pick a new one.

One path leads to others feeling positive about the situation, while another path might lead to negative outcomes. Your job is to pick the best path for each character. In these videos, our characters are faced with decisions of whether they should say something or keep that thought in their head. We call this Think It or Say It. If you have a thought that will hurt someone’s feelings, it’s best to keep that thought in your head. Other times, you might have to say something to solve a problem or help someone out.

On the other side, she could focus on the things she liked about Rachel’s performance, and keep the negative parts in her head. What do you think will happen down each path?

Let’s see how that made Rachel feel. Rachel: I didn’t realize it was that obvious I messed up. Now I’m really embarrassed. Let’s watch what happens when she focuses on the good parts of Rachel’s performance. Rachel: I saw you at the chorus concert. Leah: Yeah. My brother is in the 7th Grade Chorus so my family went. Rachel: Did you see my solo? I was so nervous. Do you think it went okay? Leah: I didn’t think Rachel was very good during her solo. What should I say? Well, I don’t want to hurt Rachel’s feelings. I should be positive and say what I thought the good parts of her performance were. Yeah, you have a really great singing voice. Rachel: Thank you! I thought I messed up some of the words a little. Leah: That’s okay! Your voice sounded awesome! Rachel: Thank you! Let’s see what Rachel was thinking after that. Rachel: Leah made me feel better about my performance. I know I messed up a little bit, but I’m glad my voice sounded good. Did those paths go the way you thought they were going to? Which path would you pick? The best path for Rachel to take was to focus on the good parts of Leah’s performance. Why was focusing on the parts of Rachel's performance she liked a good path for Leah to take? Sometimes, we can be too honest with people. If we always say exactly what we’re thinking, we might hurt people’s feelings. When someone asks us how they did on something, they are generally looking for a positive answer. Honesty is important but we can be honest without saying unnecessary or hurtful things. Rachel's solo was already over so she can't change the fact that she messed up some words. Bringing it up to her doesn't solve any problems. It just makes Rachel feel bad. Saying what she thought the good parts were, and keeping the negative thoughts in her head was a way Leah could still be honest and make sure her friend felt good. Zach and Justin are working on math problems when Justin reaches a social fork. Let’s watch. Zach: These formulas are so hard! Justin: I did mine in two seconds. Zach: Well, it's taking me forever. Justin: I was able to get to the back page too. Zach: Good for you! Justin: I’m really good at math. I bet Zach will be impressed and think I’m smart if I tell him how good I am at it. Justin is at a social fork. On one side of the fork, he could not tell Zach how good he is at math. On the other side, he could tell Zach how good he is at math. What do you think will happen down each path? Let’s see how each path goes. First, we’ll see what happens when Justin keeps the thoughts about his math skills in his head. Zach: These formulas are so hard! Justin: I did mine in two seconds. Zach: Well, it's taking me forever. Justin: I was able to get to the back page too. Zach: Good for you! Justin: I’m really good at math. I bet Zach will be impressed and think I’m smart if I tell him how good I am at it. But... I probably shouldn’t. Zach is frustrated and that wouldn’t make him feel great. But I am really good at math, so maybe I could help him! There’s a formula chart at the end of the chapter that’s really helpful. Zach: Okay, yeah, I’ll take a look! Justin: It also helps if you carry the numbers throughout the entire problem. Zach: Do you think you can help me with the first one? Justin: Sure, no problem. Let’s see how that made Zach feel. Zach: I was getting frustrated and I was upset that Justin was done so early. But I appreciate that he helped me. It made it easier. Now we’ll see what happens when Justin talks about how easy math is for him. Zach: These formulas are so hard! Justin: I did mine in two seconds. Zach: Well, it's taking me forever! Justin: I was able to get to the back page too. Zach: Good for you! Justin: I’m really good at math. I bet Zach will be impressed and think I’m smart if I tell him how good I am at it. Math is so easy for me. I’m thinking of moving up a level. Zach: Well, it’s not that easy for everyone. Let’s see what Zach was thinking after that. Zach: Justin is making me so mad! I’m having a hard time and he keeps talking about how easy it is for him! Did those paths go the way you thought they were going to go? Which path was a better choice for Justin? Not bragging was the best path for Justin to take. Why was resisting the urge to brag a good path for Justin? It can feel good to brag because we let everyone know how good we are at something. But usually, people don’t want to hear about how good someone is at something, especially if they are struggling with it themselves. Bragging can make them feel frustrated and annoyed, so it’s best to only think these thoughts and not say them. By not bragging, we are being humble or modest. You aren't showing off. You know you’re good at something, but you don’t have to tell everyone. Rachel overhears a conversation between Leah and Justin when she comes to a social fork. She hears someone make a mistake but doesn’t know if she should correct them or not. Justin: Are you going on the field trip for French club? Leah: Oh, yeah, I forgot about that. When is the permission slip due? Justin: I think next week. Leah: Oh, okay, I’ll do it then. Rachel: Justin is wrong. The permission slip is due by the end of this week! It’s Thursday, so they have to do it by tomorrow. Should I say something? Rachel is at a social fork. On one side of the fork, she could not say anything to Justin because she doesn’t want to correct him. On the other side, she could tell them it’s actually due tomorrow. What do you think will happen down each path? First, we’ll see what happens when Rachel keeps her thoughts inside her head. Justin: Are you going on the field trip for French club? Leah: Oh, yeah, I forgot about that. When is the permission slip due? Justin: I think next week. Leah: Oh, okay, I’ll do it then. Rachel: Justin is wrong. The permission slip is due by the end of this week! It’s Thursday, so they have to do it by tomorrow. Should I say something? I don’t want to correct them because they might get mad at me. I just won’t say anything. Rachel: Are you ready for the trip to the movies after school today? Leah: I’m not going. I didn’t turn in the permission slip on time. Rachel: Oh... that’s too bad. Let’s see how Leah feels after she missed the field trip. Leah: I really wanted to go on the trip to the movies. It’s going to be so much fun, but I'm missing it. Let’s watch what happens when Rachel says her thoughts out loud and directly corrects Justin. Justin: Are you going on the field trip for French club? Leah: Oh, yeah, I forgot about that. When is the permission slip due? Justin: I think next week. Leah: Oh, okay, I’ll do it then. Rachel: Justin is wrong. The permission slip is due by the end of this week! It’s Thursday, so they have to do it by tomorrow. Should I say something? I should let them know they only have one more day to get the permission slip in. Otherwise, they might not be able to go. Actually, it’s due by the end of the week, so you should probably do it tonight. Leah: Oh! Okay, thanks for telling me. I’ll definitely do it tonight. Let’s see what Leah was thinking after that. Leah: I’m glad Rachel told me that the permission slip is due tomorrow. I really want to go on the trip! Did those paths go the way you thought they were going to go? Which path would you pick? The best path was correcting Justin and telling Leah when the permission slip was due. Why was this a good time to correct someone? Correcting people can be tricky. If we constantly correct someone, they can feel annoyed. But sometimes, there are things people need to know about, so we are helping them. In this case, Rachel used direct language to tell Justin and Leah they were wrong about when the permission slip was due. If she didn’t correct them and kept the thought inside her head, they might have missed out on the trip, which would have made them upset! When you’re thinking about when to correct someone, think about the consequences of not correcting them. Sometimes it won’t matter, so you can keep the thought in your head. Other times, we should correct people so we can help them. Great work! We saw many different times when we can say something out loud and when it’s best to keep that thought in our heads. We saw how being too honest can be hurtful, how bragging makes others feel annoyed and upset, and how there are times when you should tell someone when they’ve made a mistake. Before you say something, pause to see if you should think it or say it! Keep thoughts in your head if they will hurt someone or cause a problem, but you should say things if they will help others or solve a problem. Think about the social forks in your life and the choices you can make. Remember that you have the power to choose actions that lead to a positive path! "," - Welcome to Fork in the Road, a game where you see where two different behaviors will take you. We’ll watch each situation and think about how the character's actions make everyone else feel. Each main character will come to a Social Fork, a time when they can control how the interaction will go. One path leads to others feeling positive about the situation, while another path might lead to negative outcomes. Your job is to pick the best path for each character. In these videos, our characters are faced with decisions of whether they should say something or keep that thought in their head. We call this Think It or Say It. If you have a thought that will hurt someone’s feelings, it’s best to keep that thought in your head. Other times, you might have to say something to solve a problem or help someone out. Let’s get started. Leah is talking to Rachel about her chorus performance when she reaches a social fork. Rachel: I saw you at the chorus concert. Leah: Yeah. My brother is in the 7th Grade Chorus so my family went. Rachel: Did you see my solo? I was so nervous. Do you think it went okay? Leah: I didn’t think Rachel was very good during her solo. What should I say? Leah is at a social fork. She didn’t really like Rachel’s performance. On one side of the fork, she could tell Rachel exactly how she feels. On the other side, she could focus on the things she liked about Rachel’s performance, and keep the negative parts in her head. What do you think will happen down each path",0.8277428025

This video focuses on Body Language - how what our bodies are doing can affect the messages we send to other people. Each video has two characters, so before each round, you can pick two people to act out the scene and assign them to Person A and Person B. We’ll give you the scenario to role play, and let you know how each character is feeling. The rest of the group can rate the actors based on their performance. How did their actions match up with the emotions they were supposed to feel? After the role play is finished, we’ll show this icon, and we can discuss how everyone is feeling. What happened in the scene? Did emotions change from the beginning of the scene to the end? Let’s get started! In this scenario, Matt wants to talk to Christine. Christine is busy but wants to show Matt she’s listening and cares about what he has to say. While you’re watching, think about how to listen with your entire body. Matt: Hey Christine, do you have a second? Christine: Sure. What's up? Matt: I wanted to talk to you about the project. Christine: Is everything okay? Matt: I think my part is too much work and I need some help on it. Christine: Let's talk to the group about it. Now get ready to role play! Choose who is going to be Person A and Person B. Remember the Scenario: Person A comes up to person B with a problem to talk about. You can use our problem, a class project, or come up with your own. Person B wants to show person A that they are listening. They face Person A with their body, make eye contact, and use a sincere tone of voice. Now it's time to rate the role playing. How did it go? Let’s rate Person A. How did they let person B know they had something important to talk about? How did they explain their problem? What would you give them out of five stars? How about Person B? Did they turn their bodies to face person A? Did they make eye contact? What would you give them out of five stars? Great job role playing! In this scenario, Mike wants to tell Serena about his new job. Serena says she’s interested, but then starts texting while Mike is talking. While you’re watching, think about how Mike feels after Serena starts texting. How does his voice and body language change? Mike: So, what are you doing over vacation? Serena: I still have basketbal practice and rehearsal for chorus. How about you? Mike: I'm actually starting a new job at the supermarket. I just got hired last week and, uh... um... Are you busy? Serena: No, it's fine. Keep going. Mike: Okay. Um... Anyways, I'm going to be restocking shelves and... Why don't we talk some other time? Serena: Alright, see you. Mike: Bye. Now get ready to role play! Choose who is going to be Person A and Person B. Remember the Scenario: Person A is talking to Person B about vacation plans. Person B starts texting in the middle of the conversation. You don’t have to actually text, you can just pretend. Person A isn’t sure if they should continue to talk.

How about Person B? Where did their attention start? Where did their attention go after they started texting? What would you give them out of five stars? Nice role playing! In this scene, Matt is frustrated with his homework. Christine notices and offers to help him with it.

Christine: Oh, is that for Math? Do you want some help? Matt: Sure. I can't figure out how to convert this fraction into a decimal. Christine: Oh, okay. Let's check it out.

What would you give them out of five stars? How about Person B? How did they act when talking to someone who is frustrated? How did they help Person A solve their problem? What would you give them out of five stars? Nice job! In this scene, Serena asks Tyler about tryouts. Tyler’s body language changes, and he says they went okay. Serena notices that he doesn’t really want to talk about it, and offers him support. While you’re watching, think about how you can tell when someone doesn’t want to discuss something. Serena: Hey, Tyler. How did tryouts go? Tyler: Um... they were fine. Serena: Is everything okay? Tyler: Uh, I didn't do too well. I don't really want to talk about it. Serena: Alright. Well, I'm here if you need me. Tyler: Thanks. Now get ready to role play! Choose who is going to be Person A and Person B. Remember the Scenario: Person A asks person B about tryouts. Person B’s body language changes and they say, “Um, they went okay.” Person A realizes that something is wrong, and asks person B. Now it's time to rate the role playing. How did it go? Let’s rate Person A. What made them notice something was wrong? How did they offer to help? What would you give them out of five stars? How about Person B?

",Using Humor & Sarcasm,,,,,,https://res.cloudinary.com/everyday-speech/raw/upload/v1619184978/SubtitlesVTT/A58_-_Understanding_Humor.vtt," Understanding humor is knowing when someone is trying to be funny, and getting the joke. It’s important for making and keeping relationships with others. Using humor helps us stay in a social group because people like to joke around and laugh with each other. If we don’t work to understand others’ humor, we can feel left out. These situations can make us feel as though people are laughing at us when they aren’t. They’re laughing at a joke. How can we tell when something is supposed to be funny? Usually something is funny because it’s surprising or unexpected. Here are a few types of humor. All of them have a different way of being unexpected or surprising. The first type of humor is sarcasm. If someone is being sarcastic, it means they are saying something that is an exaggeration or the opposite of what they mean. The second type of humor is telling funny stories. If someone is telling a funny story, the funny part will often be the unexpected part. The third type of humor is friendly teasing. Light teasing is one way friends bond with each other. Lastly, exaggerating or making fun of ourselves is a type of humor. If someone is making fun of themselves, they’re trying to joke around with us. What do we do if we don’t think someone’s humor was funny? We show good social manners with a smile, a short laugh, or a comment like, “That’s funny.” We do these things to help people feel comfortable around us. Knowing the different types of humor helps us understand when people are being funny. Sarcasm is exaggerating or saying the opposite of what you mean. Funny stories usually have an unexpected part. Light teasing between friends is common. People often make fun of themselves to be funny. Now, we’re going to watch four different scenes. After each scene, pause to figure out which type of humor you saw. Kai: I gotta cut this paper. Just give me one second. Niko: Why use scissors when my amazing hair could cut through that for you. Kai: Yeah, that hair could cut through anything. What type of humor did Niko use? Sarcasm Funny Story Friendly Teasing Laughing at yourself Niko used laughing at himself. He made a joke about his hair being spiky enough to cut paper. People often make jokes about themselves to be silly. Let’s see another one. Emma: So, my brother came down with this tube and he was like, “Mom, don’t buy this toothpaste again. It’s horrible!” and I was like, “You mean the hand lotion that you’re using as toothpaste is horrible?” Anika: Oh my God! I can't believe he didn’t realize! Emma: I know. It was crazy! What type of humor did Emma use? Sarcasm Funny Story Friendly Teasing Laughing at yourself Emma told a funny story. Did you notice how the funny part was the unexpected part? It’s surprising that her brother didn’t notice he was using hand lotion as toothpaste, which makes for a funny story. Let’s see another one. Anika: So, what did you do this weekend? Shay: Chores. We cleaned the basement, the yard, and the garage. Anika: That does not sound too fun. Shay: Oh, it was! I couldn't think of a better way to spend my weekend than doing chores all day long. What type of humor did Shay use? Sarcasm Funny Story Friendly Teasing Laughing at yourself Shay was being sarcastic. He figured Anika would know he didn’t really want to do chores all day. He was saying the opposite of what he really meant, which was that cleaning was boring. Let’s see one more. Shay: You know, I saw how you played that. You're all like, “I could be in a group with Anika.” Kai: I was just trying to create fair groups. Shay: Fair groups, with Anika. Kai: Fair groups are very important. What type of humor did Shay use? Sarcasm Funny Story Friendly Teasing Laughing at yourself Shay teased his friend Kai in a friendly way about trying to be put in a big group with a girl he likes. We saw lots of different ways to use humor. In all cases, using humor helped friends have fun and bond with each other. So, What Did We Learn?

When people disagree, we can compromise. This solves the problem quickly. Compromising is giving up part of what you want to let someone have part of what they want. How do we do this? The first step is knowing what to expect. Expect to get what you want some of the time, but not all of the time. This is just a natural part of being with other people. We do this because it’s more important to keep people happy than it is to get what we want. Next, decide what you’re giving up and what’s important for you to keep. Then, tell the other person your new suggestion; what you’ll give up and what you’ll keep. We do this politely and kindly. We suggest our idea by saying phrases like: Why don’t we... How about if we... What if we... For example, “How about if we eat hamburgers, then we can play video games?” To compromise: Expect to get what you want some of the time, but not all of the time when you’re with people. Figure out what part of your plan you’re giving up and what part you’re getting. Suggest a compromise with words like: Why don’t we... How about if we... What if we... Let’s see what compromising looks like. Maya: Okay, guys, we need a group captain, a researcher, and someone doing graphics. Natalie: I can help with the graphics. Niko: Can I be captain? Maya: Actually, I was kind of hoping to be the group captain. I haven’t been captain on any of these projects. Niko: Oh, then you can be captain. Natalie: Totally fine with me. Maya: Thanks, guys. Niko: That leaves me with researcher then. Maya: The thing is, researcher is the biggest job, so if you want, I can help you. Niko: Sounds good to me. Natalie: Great! Maya: It was really nice that Niko let me be captain. I would work with him again. Natalie: It was fun working with this group. We all compromised and made a plan together. Niko: I gave up being captain for the good of the group. We can’t always get what we want. It felt better to work together. When I work with a group, it’s important to compromise. I know I’m going to get some of what I want and give up some things, too. It wasn’t a big deal for me not to be captain. But it would be a big deal if our group started arguing. Niko helped his group work together because he suggested a good compromise that made everyone happy. So, what did we learn?

For example, “How about if we eat hamburgers, then we can play video games?” To compromise: Expect to get what you want some of the time, but not all of the time when you’re with people. Figure out what part of your plan you’re giving up and what part you’re getting. Suggest a compromise with words like: Why don’t we... How about if we... What if we... Let’s see what compromising looks like. Maya: Okay, guys, we need a group captain, a researcher, and someone doing graphics. Natalie: I can help with the graphics. Niko: Can I be captain? Maya: Actually, I was kind of hoping to be the group captain. I haven’t been captain on any of these projects. Niko: Oh, then you can be captain. ",0.4237088749

Disagreeing is okay as long as we show respect and know when we should speak up. If you want to share your opinion or correct a teacher, think about how you can say it. It's alright to give our opinion as long as we show respect for the adult's opinion. We show respect by thinking about our tone of voice and the words we use. It's more respectful to say your opinion or suggestion indirectly. Use phrases like these to help adults consider your ideas: “I see your point. Another way to look at it is ___.” “Do you think ____?” “It might be a good idea to think about ____.” An Indirect Opener is a way to open or start a conversation by talking around something, rather than directly stating it. To respectfully disagree with an adult: Use polite words and tone of voice Use indirect openers like questions Let’s see what it looks like when Leah is disrespectful with her teacher. Teacher: In our next unit, we're going to be reading some poems by the most famous American poet, Robert Frost. Yes, Leah? Leah: Actually, Emily Dickinson is the most famous American poet. She wrote over 1,800 poems. Teacher: Well, that’s a matter of opinion, but there are many important and influential poets. Leah: Why would we waste our time reading Frost poems? He's not even good. Teacher: You might disagree, but now is not the time to state your opinion. How was Leah disrespectful when she disagreed with her teacher? How did that make her classmates feel? Let's see what they're thinking. Justin: I think Leah is gonna get detention. Rachel: I can't believe she's talking to our teacher like that. Leah's classmates feel shocked by how she spoke to her teacher. By stating her opinion so directly, she was rude to her teacher. Even when we disagree with an adult, we need to remember to show respect. There are respectful ways to state a differing opinion. Let's see what that looks like. Teacher: In our next unit, we're going to be reading some poems by the most famous American poet, Robert Frost. Yes, Leah? Leah: Would you say that Emily Dickinson is just as famous? I think so because she has so many poems. Teacher: I would say she's a very famous and important poet. We're going to be reading poems from her and a few others too. Let’s start on page 66. Leah was able to respectfully state her own opinion which differed from her teacher’s. She changed the words she used from telling her teacher to asking her teacher. This was a more indirect way to express her thoughts. The way we say things can make a big difference. So next time you disagree with an adult, make sure to be respectful.

It can be even harder to wait when we need help. We can practice reading the room or looking at others to see when it's a good time to ask for help.

Teacher: Okay, we can take a look at it. Jack: But I need help on number four. Teacher: Well, I'm working with Madison right now. Jack: But what happens if I lose my idea? Teacher: You need to be listening and maybe it will help you too. Jack: Ugh! Jack was having trouble with his work, and didn't wait for a good time to ask for help. He interrupted his teacher while she was working with Madison. How do you think this made Madison feel? Madison: Jack kept interrupting when I was getting help. He should wait his turn.

Ms. Lehane is helping Madison now. I could listen and see if what she says will help me with number four too. Teacher: Let's read the question and see what they're asking for. Madison: Oh, they want to know what materials are used. Teacher: Mm-hmm. Jack: I think now is a good time to ask a question. Ms. Lehane is done with Madison. Teacher: Yes, Jack? Jack: Is this a two-part question? Teacher: It is. They want to know the material used and why. Jack: Oh... That time, Jack was able to read the room and wait for a good time to ask for help. He noticed when the teacher was free. He also listened while the teacher helped Madison because he had the same questions as her. When he listened, he was able to get the help he needed. Then, he waited to check in with the teacher when she wasn't busy. Nice job waiting, Jack! What did we learn? Reading the room helps us find the best time for our actions.

You’re able to tune in to what’s happening and watch how others are acting. That helps you figure out how you should act. We change the way we behave depending on who is there and where we are. Throughout the day, we find ourselves in many different situations. It’s important that our actions fit each one. In order to be a Social Chameleon, we can: Tune in to our surroundings – observe where we are and who is there. Read people’s mood and try to see how others are feeling. Adjust our actions to fit in with the time and place. We’re going to watch each scene and decide if the person was being a Social Chameleon and adapting to the situation or not. Every time we see this icon in the corner, we should stop and discuss what happened. Think about how the characters are feeling and why. Let’s get started! Round 1 Kai: Hey, Jackson. You look worried. What’s wrong? Jackson: Well, my grandfather. He's been in the hospital the whole week. Madison: Who wants to hear a joke? Andy: Maybe later. Madison: It’s a really good one! You’ll love it. Kai: Okay... I guess... Madison: Okay. Why did the chicken cross the road? Did Madison fit into the conversation like a Social Chameleon? Pause for discussion. Madison did not act like a Social Chameleon. She should have noticed what her friends were talking about and how they felt. Jackson said his grandfather was in the hospital. That would make him feel sad and worried. If Madison stopped to read people’s moods, she would have realized that this wasn't the best time to tell a joke. Madison should have kept the joke in her head and told it at another time. Round 2 Jackson: I’m so excited! Madison: I bet. Kai: Hey, what are you guys talking about? Jackson: I’m going up to see my brother this weekend in college. Kai: Cool. Where does he go? Jackson: He goes to Brown. Madison: Really? My sister went there. She really liked it. Jackson: Oh, that's so cool. Kai: When are you leaving? Jackson: Um, Friday night. Kai: Nice. Jackson: Yeah, I can't wait to go. Did Kai blend into the conversation like a Social Chameleon? Pause for discussion. He did! Kai was able to look at the group, think about their mood, and make comments about the topic they were talking about. He made sure his actions fit into what was happening, which made the group think positively about him. Round 3 Kai: I can’t wait for the weekend! Jackson: Yeah, me too! I’m going to the aquarium. Kai: Sweet! Madison: You’re going to the aquarium? Jackson: Yeah. Why? Madison: That’s so boring. It’s just fish swimming in circles. Jackson: I mean, I guess so. I don’t really think they notice. Jackson: Plus, I get a pretty good look at their fins and gills and stuff. Madison: Pfft! I wouldn’t go there if you paid me. Did Madison fit into the conversation like a Social Chameleon? Pause for discussion. Madison did not act like a Social Chameleon. Jackson was clearly excited to go to the aquarium and Madison kept making negative comments about it. Madison should have thought about what the boys were talking about and how they felt. She didn’t read their mood during the conversation. This made the boys feel like it wasn’t very fun to talk with her. Round 4 Madison: So, they said we could sign up for the holiday talent show and there's a big surprise at the end of the assembly. Maya: What’s the surprise? Madison: I’m not telling you. Then it wouldn't be a surprise. Maya: Oh, come on. Kai: Guess what! I’m going to see my cousins in California. Madison: Oh... Cool… Madison: So... are you going to sign up for the talent show? Kai: I’m going to take a tour in Hollywood. Have you guys ever been? Maya: Uh… No. Did Kai fit into the conversation like a Social Chameleon? Pause for discussion. Kai did not act like a Social Chameleon because he interrupted the girls’ conversation and tried to force a new topic by talking about his trip. In order to join their conversation, he should have noticed the topic they were talking about and made a comment about that. Being a Social Chameleon can look different in many situations. If we observe others, we’ll know how to adjust our actions to match the situation and blend in. When we want to talk with others, we should notice what they’re talking about and read their mood. This helps us know how to enter the conversation and fit in. If we don’t try to blend in to their conversations, we can make others feel upset or uncomfortable. What did we learn? In order to blend in and fit into any situation, a Social Chameleon will: Tune in to their surroundings – observe where they are and who is there. Read people’s mood and try to see how others are feeling. Adjust our actions to fit in with the time and place.

In this video, we’ll play a fun game where we try to guess how different people are feeling. After we figure out how each person is feeling, we’ll mark that emotion on our bingo board. If you get four emotions in a row -- up, down, or diagonal -- you can say “bingo!” The first person to get bingo is the winner! Whenever we see this icon in the corner, we can stop and talk about how everyone is feeling. Let’s get started! Let’s focus on Serena. How do you think this situation makes her feel? Liz: I wanted to work on my science project today, but I left my book at home. Serena: You can use mine. Liz: Great! Thanks! Serena: No problem! How do we think Serena feels? Serena lent her book to Liz. To show that she was thankful for the book, Liz said ""Thank you"" to Serena. This made Serena feel... Happy. You can tell she was happy because she was smiling and her voice sounded happy. Find ""Happy"" on your board, and mark it! This time, we'll focus on Serena and Devin. Serena: So, what did you guys do this weekend? Andrew: I went to the mall with my family. Devin: I had a basketball game. We played the... How do we think Serena and Devin feel? Andrew, Devin and Serena were having a conversation when Andrew got up in the middle of the conversation and didn’t say anything. This made Serena and Devin feel … Confused. We can tell that they feel confused because they’re moving their eyebrows up and down and looking at each other as if they don’t understand what’s happening. Andrew should remember that every time we end a conversation, we should say goodbye. Find “Confused’ on your board, and mark it! Let’s focus on Jeff. He’s taking notes on a video his class is watching. Try to figure out how he feels. Teacher: Everyone, take out your note packets. We’re going to fill in the section about the skeletal system. Pay close attention to the video and fill in the answer choices. Mike: Hey, do you know the skeleton's favorite instrument? A trombone. Hey, do you know which skeleton won the beauty contest? Jeff: Shhh! Mike: Nobody! Jeff: I just missed an answer! How do we think Jeff feels? Jeff was trying to focus on the video when Mike kept making jokes and distracting him. Jeff’s face looks serious and his voice sounds a bit upset. Jeff is... Annoyed. Find ""Annoyed"" on your board, and mark it! This time, we’re going to focus on Mike. Mike: Hey Kate, come look at this drawing I made. Aww! Kate: Sorry. Mike: What did you do that for? These are my favorite shoes! Kate: Jeez. Chill out! It was an accident. Mike: It doesn't matter. Don't touch my sneakers! Mike didn’t like it when Kate stepped on his sneaker. How do you think he feels? Mike loves his sneakers and doesn’t want them to be ruined. He was angry that Kate stepped on them. We can tell Mike felt angry because his voice was raised, and he had a very serious tone of voice. His face was also getting a little bit red. Mike needs to take a second and think from Kate’s point of view. Did she mean to step on his sneakers? Find “Angry” on your board, and mark it! This time, we’re going to look at how Kate was feeling after Sarah gets back a test. Teacher: Okay, class, I have your math test. Sarah: Ugh! I worked so hard on this! This test isn't fair! We had too much to study! Teacher: Why don’t you come up to my desk and we'll talk about it. Sarah: Fine! Kate looked like she wasn’t expecting Sarah to act that way in school. How do you think she was feeling? When Sarah had a big reaction, Kate felt... Surprised. We can tell she feels surprised because she raised her eyebrows and opened her mouth a little bit. She didn’t expect Sarah to start yelling in school. Find “Surprised” on your board, and mark it! Let’s see how Bobby feels when he’s doing some schoolwork. Bobby: Ugh… Come on! I can’t do it! Bobby was having some trouble with his work. How do you think that made him feel? Sometimes when we have a problem that we can’t seem to fix, we can feel like Bobby felt. He felt... Frustrated. We can tell he was feeling frustrated because Bobby ripped his paper and yelled. Then he crossed his arms and had an upset look on his face. His eyes were closed and his lip was curled. Next time Bobby is feeling frustrated, he can use his strategies. He can take a deep breath, or ask his teacher to take a break. Find “Frustrated” on your board, and mark it! This time, we’re going to take a look at Alessandra. She’s having a birthday party and wants to invite Devin. Pay attention to how Devin makes her feel. Alessandra: Hey Devin, my birthday is this Saturday. I’m having a party at my house and it'd be great if you could come. Let me know? Devin: Eh, no thanks. I don’t really want to go. Devin handed back the invitation and said he didn’t want to go. How do you think that made Alessandra feel? Why? It’s okay to decline an invitation to a birthday party, but when Devin didn’t even think about it and handed Alessandra the card back, she felt... Sad. Alessandra spent time to make an invitation for Devin, and he immediately handed it back to her. She started looking at the ground and her smile disappeared. This is how we know she was feeling sad. Find “Sad” on your board, and mark it! Let’s take a look at Serena in this video. She has some news to share with Alessandra. Serena: Hey Alessandra! Guess what? I made the soccer team! Alessandra: Congratulations! I didn’t make it. Serena: You’re really good! You can try out again next year. Alessandra: Thanks. Serena just made the soccer team. How do you think she feels? Serena was Excited to make the soccer team. Alessandra didn’t make the team but she saw that Serena was really excited, so she congratulated her. Alessandra was a good friend! Find “Excited” on your board, and mark it! This time, we’re going to take a look at Alessandra. How does she feel after Serena reacts to a change in her schedule? Alessandra: Do you guys know what we’re doing in gym class today? Bobby: We don’t have gym class today. We're going to an assembly. Serena: What? Bobby: We're going to an assembly. Serena: But today is Monday and we always have gym on Monday! When Serena had a big reaction to the schedule changing, she started yelling. How did that make Alessandra feel? Alessandra looked around the table. Serena’s actions made her feel... Uncomfortable. We can tell from her face and body language that Serena’s actions made Alessandra feel uncomfortable. Find “Uncomfortable” on your board, and mark it! For our final round, let’s see how Liz, Alessandra, and Bobby look during a class party. Chris: Hmmm, these look good! Serena: Ooh, I love granola! Bobby: Eew! Liz: Ugh! Alessandra: She just touched these! Serena was touching everyone’s food. How do you think that made the rest of the group feel? When someone does something that might make you feel sick or grossed out, you might feel... Disgusted. The rest of the group didn’t want to eat food that Serena had touched and smelled. Serena needs to remember that at a party, you only touch food you are going to eat. Find “Disgusted” on your board, and mark it! Great job, everyone! We went over a lot of different emotions today. Remember to look at someone’s face and body language, and listen to how their voice sounds. These can be big clues to how someone is feeling. Thanks for playing! See you next time!

Something happened there. Let's see what Alessandra is thinking. Alessandra: I didn't want to say anything, but Tim's breath smelled really bad. I couldn't wait for the discussion to be over. Alessandra feels uncomfortable because Tim had bad breath. Now let's see what Tim is thinking. It seemed like Alessandra didn't want to talk to me. Did I do something wrong? That was really weird.

If our solution doesn’t work, we can try again. Problem solving is a process. We won’t always go straight to the solution.

Let’s see how it all plays out. Alessandra: Hey, could I borrow your iPad for study hall? Tyler: Uh, sure. Just be sure to give it back to me. Alessandra: Thanks! Oh no! I broke the screen! Uh-oh. Now we’ll tackle the first step of problem solving. We need to identify what the problem is. What’s the problem here? Alessandra: I broke Tyler's iPad! And there's no way I can pay for it! Alessandra broke Tyler’s iPad screen! That is her problem. Now we move on to the second step - figuring out the size of the problem. Look at your problem solving scale. Where would you put this on the scale? How big is the problem? Alessandra: This is a big problem. I can't solve it myself. What should I do now? This problem is big, but not the biggest type of problem. We think it’s medium-big because Alessandra can't solve it herself, and it will cost money, but nobody got hurt.

Alessandra: I could tell him it wasn't my fault or I could take responsibility and tell him I broke it or maybe I just won't say anything. You might have come up with different solutions, and that’s okay. The next step is to pick a solution. Should Alessandra say it wasn’t her fault, say nothing, or take responsibility? Let’s watch Alessandra pick a solution. Alessandra: I'll take responsibility. That's the right thing to do. I'll need to ask my parents for help. Alessandra decided to take responsibility. The final step is to try the solution and reassess or think about how it went. Let’s see Alessandra try. Alessandra: Hey Tyler, I have to tell you something. Tyler: What is it? Alessandra: I'm so sorry, but I broke your iPad screen. Tyler: Oh no! Alessandra: I feel really bad, but I'll find a way to fix it. Tyler: Alright. I hope so. Alessandra: I'll talk to my parents. We'll get it fixed. I promise. Let’s reassess. Do you think Alessandra picked the best solution? Alessandra: It was really hard to tell Tyler that I broke his iPad. But I'm glad I did it!

This video focuses on Empathy - how we can relate to how other people are feeling. We can try to see from someone else’s perspective or point of view. Each video has two characters, so before each round, you can pick two people to act out the scene and assign them to Person A and Person B. We’ll give you the scenario to role play, and let you know how each character is feeling. The rest of the group can rate the actors based on their performance. How did their actions match up with the emotions they were supposed to feel? After the role play is finished, we’ll show this icon and we can discuss how everyone is feeling. What happened in the scene? Did emotions change from the beginning of the scene to the end? Let’s get started! In this scenario, Christine is upset about her math test when Matt comes up. Matt recognizes that she’s sad, and gives her some words of encouragement. He talks about a test he didn’t do well on and gives her some advice. By showing her that he’s had something similar happen to him, he’s able to make her feel better. While you’re watching, think about how Matt uses a similar experience to make Christine feel better. Matt: Hey, Christine. What's up? Christine: I didn't do so well in the Math test. I'm not feeling so great. Matt: Aww, that stinks. I got a bad grade on my History test a week ago. I was pretty upset about that too. I'm sorry. Christine: Thanks. Matt: Maybe you could talk to the teacher. I was able to get extra credit and raise my grade. Christine: That sounds like a good idea. Now get ready to role play! Choose who is going to be Person A and Person B. Remember the Scenario: Person A looks sad because you didn’t do well on a math test. Person B comes up and relates to them about a time they didn’t do well on a test. Now it's time to rate the role playing. How did it go? Let’s rate Person A. How did they show they were sad? How were they feeling by the end of the scenario? What would you give them out of five stars? How about Person B? How did they relate to what Person A was going through? What did they say to make Person A feel better? What would you give them out of five stars? Great job! In this scenario, Alessandra is telling Serena about some plans she just made with her mom. She’s going to see some musicals. Serena isn’t interested in musicals, but when Alessandra asks, she says it sounds cool. She wants to make Alessandra feel good. While you’re watching, think about how Serena acts when a friend is talking about something that she isn’t interested in. How do her words, body language, and voice encourage Alessandra? Alessandra: Guess what? My parents got us tickets to go see some musicals on Broadway. Isn't that awesome? Serena: Yeah, that sounds really cool. When are you going? Alessandra: In a couple of weeks. I can't wait! Serena: That will be a blast! Have fun! Alessandra: Thanks! Now get ready to role play! Choose who is going to be Person A and Person B. Remember the Scenario: Person A tells person B about an event they are going to. You can use our example of musicals, or choose your own! Person B isn’t interested in that event, but doesn’t show it. They make Person A feel good about it. Now it's time to rate the role playing. How did it go? Let’s rate Person A. How excited did they sound? Did they end the conversation feeling good? What would you give them out of five stars? How about Person B? Did they hide that they weren’t interested? How did they encourage person A? What would you give them out of five stars? Nice role playing! In this scenario, Josh tells Liz that he made the football team! Liz isn’t really interested in football and doesn’t care. She doesn’t think about how happy Josh is, and she keeps talking about the class party. While you’re watching, think about how Josh feels after Liz doesn’t show she’s excited that he made the team. Why do people want to tell us about important things in their lives? Josh: I forgot to tell you. I made the football team! Liz: Wow, that's great. Did you hear we're having a pizza party later? Josh: Oh, yeah. I heard about that. Anyway, I thought I wasn't going to make it, but I did! Liz: I hope they have pepperoni. That's my favorite. Josh: Oh, yeah. Now get ready to role play! Choose who is going to be Person A and Person B. Remember the Scenario: Person A tells Person B about something big that just happened to them. You can use our example of making the football team, or choose your own! Person B isn’t interested, and would rather keep talking about the class party. Now it's time to rate the role playing. How did it go? Let’s rate Person A. How excited did they sound in the beginning? What did they sound and look like by the end? What would you give them out of five stars? How about Person B? How did they show they weren’t interested? Did they keep talking about something else? What would you give them out of five stars? Nice role playing! In this scene, Matt is upset with Josh for not coming to his house yesterday. Josh couldn’t come because he had a doctor’s appointment. They don’t see the situation from the other's point of view and they end the conversation upset. While you’re watching, think about how not using empathy can turn small problems into big ones. Matt: Hey Josh, why didn't you show up yesterday? We were all waiting for you. Josh: My doctor's appointment ran late. I told you I might not be able to come. Matt: You should have called me. Josh: There wasn't a phone in the doctor's office. Besides, I told you I had an appointment. Matt: You should still let me know. Josh: I don't want to talk about this anymore. Matt: Ugh! Now get ready to role play! Choose who is going to be Person A and Person B. Remember the Scenario: Person A is mad at Person B for not coming over. Person B explains they had a doctor’s appointment and couldn’t come over. Both people don’t listen to each other, and they don’t solve their problem. Now it's time to rate the role playing. How did it go? Let’s rate Person A. How did they show they were mad? What did they look like when the scene was over? What would you give them out of five stars? How about Person B? Did they listen to person A? How did they show they were mad? What would you give them out of five stars? This is a great example of how not showing empathy can lead to bigger problems. In this scene, Alessandra asks Serena if she can borrow her English book for class. Serena has to use it later, so she doesn’t want to give it away. After they see the situation from the other person’s point of view, they come up with a compromise. While you’re watching, think about how understanding someone else’s point of view can help you compromise and solve problems. Alessandra: Hey, Serena. Serena: Hey! Alessandra: Do you mind if I borrow your English textbook? I left mine at home and I need it for class. Serena: Hmm... I need it to do my English homework tonight. Alessandra: Please, I really need it. I'll give it back to you right after. Serena: Well, I guess I don't need it now. You can use it as long as I get it back for my homework. Alessandra: Okay, I understand. I'll get it back to you right afterwards. Promise. Serena: Okay, sounds good. Come on! Now get ready to role play! Choose who is going to be Person A and Person B. Remember the Scenario: Person A asks person B to use their textbook. Person B doesn’t want to at first. Person A explains their point of view, and they both compromise. Now it's time to rate the role playing. How did it go? Let’s rate Person A. What did they say to explain their point of view? Did they understand why Person B wanted the book and include that in their compromise? What would you give them out of five stars? How about Person B? How did they explain their point of view? Did they understand why Person A wanted the book, and include that in their compromise? What would you give them out of five stars? That’s it for this edition of Act it Out! Nice job role playing, everyone! Showing empathy or seeing things from someone else’s point of view can help us when we have a problem with friends and compromise. We learned how to: Make someone else feel good when we realize they are excited about something... Alessandra: Guess what? My parents got us tickets to go see some musicals on Broadway. Isn't that awesome? Serena: Yeah, that sounds really cool. When are you going? Alessandra: In a couple of weeks. I can't wait! Serena: That will be a blast! Have fun! Alessandra: Thanks! And compromise when someone else needs our help. Alessandra: Hey, Serena. Serena: Hey! Alessandra: Do you mind if I borrow your English textbook? I left mine at home and I need it for class.

You can use it as long as I get it back for my homework. Alessandra: Okay, I understand. I'll get it back to you right afterwards. Promise. Serena: Okay, sounds good. Come on!

Topic Radar teaches us to think about what topics the person we're talking to is most interested in. This helps us start conversations about a wider variety of topics and not just our own favorites.

We want to make sure we talk about more than just our favorite topics. This isn’t very fun for other people. If we aren’t sure what to talk about with others, we can use the Topic Radar. This helps us remember what we know about other people. People like to talk about things you have in common or about things they’re interested in. This makes them feel excited. The skills we use are: Think about the other person’s interests. Remember what you know about them – this could be their family members, hobbies, or favorite things.

What kind of fruit? Madison: Strawberries and blueberries. Kai: Cool! I love strawberries. I want to grow my own strawberries someday. Kai: Madison came over during break and seems like she wanted to talk. I needed to stop and think about what she might like to talk about, so I used my Topic Radar. I know she likes walking her dog, trying new food, and gardening. I remembered she told me about gardening last week, so I knew I could ask her about that. When we want to talk with others, we use our Topic Radar to think about what we should talk about.

We can form positive relationships with our family members, people from school, or people in our community. Sometimes, these people become close friends, friends, or just acquaintances. Acquaintances are people we know a little. We may take some of the same classes or live in the same neighborhood, but we don't regularly talk or hangout outside of school. Having acquaintances is important because it allows us to feel comfortable or connected with people without having to share personal information or dedicate a lot of time to the relationship. It does not take much effort or energy to maintain these types of relationships. A simple wave or greeting in the hall or a ""how was your weekend?"" lets others know you're thinking about them. It may be helpful to make acquaintances with some people in your classes. Next time you need a partner for a group project or need some help on the homework, you're already connected with a few people in the class. Sometimes, it's possible for acquaintances to become friends or even close friends over time. Acquaintances are important because they: Connect us with others at school and our community. Provide social benefits, like a partner for a project or someone to sit next to. Prevent us from feeling lonely. And can turn into friends or close friends over time. Let's see if Kiara is able to make some friends or acquaintances in her class. Madison: Hi, I'm Madison. Kiara: Hi. Madison: I've heard this is a really fun class. Kiara: Mhmm. Madison: Hi, I'm Madison. Liz: Hi, I'm Liz. Madison: I've heard this class is really fun. Liz: Yeah, me too. What happened there? How do you think Kiara made Madison feel? Madison: I was trying to find some friends in class, so I'm glad I talked to Liz. Kiara: I have to get an A in this class. I don't want to chit chat. It will only distract me. Kiara's body language and lack of conversation showed Madison that she was not interested in talking to her. Kiara missed out on the opportunity to make an acquaintance in her class. Let's watch Kiara try again. Madison: Hi, I'm Madison. Kiara: I don't know anyone in this class, and I get really focused on school, but I need to remember to be friendly. Kiara: Hi, I'm Kiara. Madison: I've heard this class is really fun. Kiara: Oh good! I haven't heard anything about this class. Where did you hear that? Madison: Oh, my brother had her a couple of years ago. Kiara: How hard do you think this class will be? Madison: Hopefully easy. What did Kiara do differently that time? Let's see what everyone is thinking. Madison: I hardly know anyone in this class. It was nice to meet Kiara. Kiara: I have to remind myself that everything isn't always about academics. It's good to get to know other people in class. That time, Kiara was friendly and showed interest when Madison introduced herself. Kiara used positive body language and made connected comments and questions to continue the conversation. By the end of their conversation, Madison and Kiara went from Strangers to Acquaintances, making both of the girls feel happy. Acquaintances are important because they: Connect us with others at school and in our community. Provide social benefits, like a partner for a project or someone to sit next to.

In this video, we’ll play a fun game where we try to figure out which conversation drivers and conversation stoppers people are using! A conversation driver is a strategy you can use to start a conversation or keep it moving in the right direction. A conversation stopper stops a conversation before it’s ready to end! We want to try to use conversation drivers, and not use conversation stoppers! After we figure it out, we’ll mark the driver or stopper on our bingo board. If you get four drivers or stoppers in a row - up, down, across, or diagonal - you can say “bingo!” The first person to get bingo is the winner! Whenever we see this icon in the corner, we can stop and talk about how everyone is feeling. Let’s get started! Let’s focus on Liz. What happens when Chris tries to talk to her? Chris: Liz! Liz! Liz? Okay... That conversation never got started. What happened? Liz stopped the conversation by... Not Listening. It’s pretty hard to get a conversation started when one person isn’t showing they are listening! Liz was so focused on her iPad, that she didn’t even realize Chris was trying to talk to her. We should try to be aware of what’s happening around us. If someone is trying to talk to us, we can turn our bodies towards them and look at them so we show we are interested. Find “Not Listening” on your board, and mark it! In this video, let’s focus on Bobby. Bobby: What's up? Alessandra: Nothing much. This is my friend, Chris. Bobby: Hey, Chris. Nice to meet you. I'm Bobby. Chris: Nice to meet you too. Bobby: Hey, did you see Mark today? He has the funniest shirt on. Bobby had never met Chris before. How did he drive the conversation? Bobby drove the conversation by... Introducing Himself. If you don’t know someone, it’s hard to start a conversation. By introducing yourself, you can make the other person feel more comfortable with you. Bobby: Hey, Chris. Nice to meet you. I'm Bobby. Chris: Nice to meet you too. Once Bobby introduced himself, he was able to start the conversation. Find “Introducing Yourself” on your board, and mark it! Let’s focus on Kate. She has important news about Jeff’s birthday.

She didn’t start the conversation, she just started talking Kate: Did you know today is Jeff’s birthday? I’m going to make him a card. When she left without saying bye, Mike & Sarah were confused. Sarah: Huh? We should have a beginning and ending to our conversations. If we don’t, other people can become confused, and the conversation can stop in its tracks. Find “Not Beginning or Ending the Conversation” on your board, and mark it! This time, we’ll watch Serena. Kate: Do you ever read sci-fi books? Serena: No. That's not really my favorite type. Kate: Really? Have you heard of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy? It's so interesting and super funny at the same time. Serena: Oh, that sounds really cool. I'll look into it. Serena drove the conversation. What did she do that was so important? Serena... acted like she was interested. Serena said she wasn’t interested in sci-fi books.

Tyler: Really? We should play catch sometime. I can bring my glove in. Jake: Yeah, that'd be great. Tyler did a great job of starting a conversation there. How did he do it? Tyler drove the conversation by... Using clues. Tyler was able to observe Jake. He saw Jake’s baseball glove, and made a guess that Jake likes baseball. He likes baseball too, so he was able to start a conversation based on that. Tyler: Hey man, do you play baseball? Because I love to play. Tyler was able to start the conversation, and even set up a time to hang out with Jake. Nice job! Find “Using Clues in Conversation” on your board, and mark it! This time, let’s focus on Sarah. Kate: Hi, guys! Sarah: Why are you wearing that? Kate: I just like to wear dresses. Sarah: Well, I don't. I hate dresses. They're so uncomfortable. That conversation ended pretty quickly. How did Sarah stop it? Sarah stopped the conversation by... Not thinking, just saying. Sarah had a thought that hurt Kate’s feelings. By saying that thought out loud, she made Kate upset. Sarah: Well I don’t. I hate dresses. They’re so uncomfortable. That didn’t make Kate feel very good, and she didn’t want to talk anymore. Find “Not Thinking, Just Saying” on your board, and mark it!

What about you? Mike: I'll probably be at the skate park on Saturday. Tyler: Cool. Well, have fun. Mike: You too. That conversation almost ended. How did Mike drive it? Mike drove the conversation by... Making small talk. Mike and Tyler didn’t have anything specific to talk about. So Mike made small talk by talking about the weekend. Mike: So, are you doing anything this weekend? Tyler: Yeah, actually. I'm going out to dinner with my parents this weekend. Small talk is a quick conversation about things that almost everybody can relate to, like the weather or the weekend.

How do you think he feels about watching the movie in class? Serena: I can't wait for Science class tomorrow. We're watching a nature film on elephants. Chris: Great. I love elephants. Serena: Yeah, me too. They're really cute. I love watching them. Chris: Yeah, elephants are cool. How do you think Serena feels? Why did the conversation end? Chris stopped the conversation by...

His shoulders were slumped, And his voice sounded flat, like he didn’t care Chris: Great. I love elephants. Serena: Yeah, me too. They're reallly cute. Serena decided to stop talking about the video, because she was confused by Chris’ reaction, and thought he wasn’t interested anymore. Find “Not Matching Body Language to Your Message” on your board, and mark it! Great job everyone! We learned a lot about conversation drivers and stoppers today!

In this game, we take a look at a situation and help the characters figure out how to act. Reading the room is a tool to help us know what to do in different situations. We can change our behavior based on where we are and what's happening. When we read the room, we pause to... Think about the situation and how you usually act in that situation. Think about everyone in the room. Think about what they're doing and what they have. Make a plan based on what you see. When we want to talk to our friends, we need to find a good time to do it. Reading the room helps us figure out when they aren't busy and ready to talk. In each scene, we'll decide who the best person to talk to is based on what's happening. Anytime we see this icon in the corner, we can stop and discuss what's happening. Let's get started. Let's watch Zach look for someone to help him with his homework. Zach: I need some help with the last problem of our Math work. Let me figure out how I can get some help. First, I'll think about what's happening now. It is free time so it would be a good time to talk to a friend and get some help. Next, I'll look around to see what everyone is doing. That will help me figure out who I can ask for help. Justin is typing on the computer. It looks like he's doing some work. Leah seems to be done with her work. Rachel is talking with Ms. Lehane. Who do you think Zach should ask for help? Let's watch Zach figure it out. Zach: Now that I know what everyone is doing and have thought about the time and what our class usually does, I can pick the best person to ask for help. I want to make sure they aren't busy so I don't interrupt them. Justin was working on the computer, so he isn't a good choice. Rachel was talking to our teacher so she's busy. She wouldn't be a good choice either. Leah seems to be finished with her work and isn't in the middle of anything. She looks like the best choice to ask. I'll see if she can help me. Hey, Leah. Leah: Yeah? Zach: Do you think, if you're not busy, you can help me with my Math work? I'm having a lot of trouble with it. Leah: Sure. Let's take a look. Zach did a great job of reading the room. He was able to think about the time and place and how they usually acts. He also made sure to look at everyone and what they were doing before he ask someone for help. Let's watch Rachel look for someone to show a funny video. Rachel: I just watched such a funny video on YouTube. I really want to show someone. First, I'll think about what's happening right now. We still have 10 minutes before school starts, so I have time to talk with a friend. Next, I'll look around to see what everyone is doing. That will help me figure out who I can show the video to. Leah is reading a book. She looks really into it. Zach must be finishing some homework. Justin is getting ready for the day, but doesn't look too busy. Who do you think is the best fit to show a funny video to? Let's watch Rachel figure it out. Rachel: Now that I know what everyone is doing, I can pick the best person to show the video. I want to make sure they aren't busy so I don't interrupt them. Leah was reading a book, so it wouldn't be nice to interrupt her. Zach seems to be working pretty hard. He probably wants to finish up before school starts, so he wouldn't be a good choice. Justin was sitting at his desk. He doesn't seem to be too busy. Justin seems like the best choice. I bet he'll think this video is so funny. Hey, Justin. Justin: Hey! Rachel: Do you want to see a funny video? Justin: Sure. Rachel was able to read the room and find the best person to have some free time with. She was able to think about the time and place, and if it was a good time to watch a video. Since it was before school, it was okay. She also made sure to look at everyone and what they were doing, so she knew who to talk to. She picked the person who wasn't busy with something else. Let's watch Justin read the room and pick when to join a group. Justin: I just finished my Science reading. We have 8 minutes before the bell rings. What should I do now? I have some free time, so I'll see who I can talk to. What's everybody doing? I'd like to talk to my friends, but it looks like they're still working. I don't want to interrupt them. Looks like they finished what they were doing. When is the best time to join the group? Justin: I wanted to talk to my friends when I finished my reading. But they were still working. It wouldn't be polite to interrupt them while they are busy. After they put their books away and started chatting, it seemed like a better time. If no one's in the middle of anything, I can go over. Justin: Hey, guys! Everyone: Hi! Justin: Did you guys finish everything on the worksheet? Leah: Yeah, it wasn't too bad. Zach: We were just talking about the bake sale going on in the cafeteria. Have you seen it yet? Justin: Yeah! Those brownies look so good! Rachel: The brownies are the best! Justin did a great job of reading the room and picking the best time to join a group. He made sure to observe his classmates first and find a time when they weren't busy. The first time, the group was still working, so it wouldn't be a good time to join them. Justin waited until they were all done and not in the middle of anything. Then he went up and said ""Hey!"" and joined in the conversation. Nice job reading the room, Justin! Being observant is a very helpful tool. All of our characters read the room before making their choices on how to act. That way they didn't interrupt anyone who was busy or upset anyone. Zach found the best person to ask for help who wasn't busy with their own work. Rachel found someone to show the funny video. Justin also waited for the best time to join a group, so he didn't interrupt their studying. They made sure to: Think about the situation and how you usually act in that situation. Think about everyone in the room. Think about what they are doing and what they have. Make a plan based on what you see. Our days are made up of many constantly changing situations. If we read the room before we act, we will know how to adopt our behavior to fit each one. See you next time! "," - Welcome to Read the Room.

Cole: Oh... You're right. You're right. I had no idea! Cole: When I share food with my friends, I want to make sure I use the Restaurant Rules so I don’t do anything embarrassing or make my friends uncomfortable. I make sure to chew my food and swallow, so I don’t talk with my mouth full. Snacks can be messy, so when Julian handed me his phone, I wiped my hands off with a napkin. I also made sure there's enough food for both of us, so I tried not to eat too much of the snack too quickly because we were sharing it. I waited and made sure my friend ate some before I took any more. Whenever we eat with others, we should remember the Restaurant Rules. If we don’t use the Restaurant Rules, others might not want to be around us when we're eating. Cole uses his Self-Controller to make sure he eats slowly. If he lost control and ate too much, there wouldn't be enough snack to share. He remembers his manners by making sure to finish chewing his food before answering Julian's questions. Lastly, he uses good hygiene by wiping his hands with a napkin before using his friend’s phone. What did we learn? The Restaurant Rules help us know how to act when we eat with others, so we don’t do something impolite. This gives others good feelings about us and makes everyone comfortable while they eat.

When strong emotions take over, it can feel impossible to think about all our options and choose the right one. To make good decisions, we need positive emotions to help us think. To gain control of our emotions, we change the channel on those negative feelings by thinking something new. We’re allowing positive emotions to help us get rid of the negative ones. If we let the negative emotions take over, we’ll make mistakes in our thinking. We’ll make wrong decisions about people, we’ll assume things that are not correct, or we’ll act dangerously or out of control. Everyone has strong emotions. People who stay calm have learned to change the channel on those emotions to control them. How do we change the channel? First, we notice when the big emotion is starting and try to figure out how we feel. Think of it as taking a close look at the emotion you’re feeling and giving it a name. Is it sadness? Anger? Frustration? Next, we decide to overcome this emotion with time, a calming strategy, or a positive thought. Big emotions weaken over time. The more time we give ourselves to calm down, the better. When we change the channel on big emotions, we need to think of the best calming strategy for that moment. It could be saying you need a minute, squeezing and releasing your fists, or taking deep breaths and counting to 10. Choose what works for you. The third way you change the channel is to think a positive thought. This turns off the negative movie playing in your mind and allows more positive thoughts to help you think better. Think of one thing that’s good about the situation, or one positive good thing you can do to handle the situation. To change the channel on big emotions: Understand the emotion you’re feeling. Change the channel on that emotion by giving yourself time before you react. Use your best calming strategy. Switch from a negative to a positive channel in your mind by thinking positive thoughts. Let’s see how Julian changes the channel on his strong feelings. Teacher: Julian, everyone’s picked their groups already and they’re getting to work. Come on, let’s go! Julian: I don’t care. Teacher: Come on, you can do this. Julian: I can’t. Teacher: Why don’t you ask your group one thing you can do to help? Julian: Ugh! Teacher: Come up and talk to me. What’s going on today? Julian: I hate school and I hate this class. I hate my life and I hate this project. Teacher: Okay. Okay, I get it. Can you think of anything you like? Julian: No. I hate it all. Teacher: Can you think of one good thing about this class? Julian: No. There isn’t anything good. Teacher: Okay. Why don’t you take a break? Julian: I don’t want to. Teacher: Well, I want to help you, but I can’t unless you change your thinking a little bit. What happened there? Julian had a strong emotion. His sadness was out of control because it kept him from thinking anything else. Was this the best way to handle a tough emotion? Let’s see what others around him are thinking. Kiara: Why isn’t Julian helping us? This is supposed to be a group project. Jackson: What’s wrong with Julian? We all have to do the work. Julian: I can’t do anything today. Why can’t everyone just leave me alone? Teacher: I know Julian is having a hard time, but I can’t go in his brain and change his thoughts for him. He has to do some of it too. Julian didn’t do the three things that help change the channel on his thoughts. He didn’t give himself time, he didn’t try any strategies, and he didn’t think a new, positive thought. This made his classmates have negative thoughts about him. His teacher was also disappointed. He didn’t change the channel on his sadness, so it continued to control him. Let’s see him try again. Watch how he changes the channel on his emotions. Teacher: Julian, everyone’s picked their groups and they’re getting to work. Let’s go! Julian: I don’t care. Teacher: You can do it. Julian: I can’t. Teacher: Why don’t you ask your group one thing you can do to help? Julian: Ugh! Teacher: Come up and talk to me. What’s going on today? Julian: I hate school and I hate my life. I hate this class and I hate this project. Teacher: Okay. Okay, I get it. Can you think of anything you like? Julian: No. I hate it all. Teacher: Can you think of one good thing about this class? Julian: There isn’t anything good. Teacher: Why don’t you take a break? Julian: I don’t feel like doing anything anyone tells me to do. When I feel like this, that’s when I know I need to change the channel. I’ll take a break even though I want to say no. Julian: Okay, fine. Can I draw at my desk? Teacher: Sure. You can have a five-minute break. Julian: I need to think of something positive. I love drawing. I could see if I can draw a cartoon for each of my group’s talking points. That would make class more fun. Julian: Mrs. Brunell? Would it be alright if I cartooned all my group’s talking points? Teacher: Sure. You can do that for today, not tomorrow. Julian: Okay, that works. Let’s see what everyone was thinking that time. Kiara: I’m glad Julian is feeling better and he can help with the group project. Jackson: I know Julian is having a hard time, so I respect him for joining the group. Julian: Changing the channel on my feelings was the only thing that helped me. It feels good to be back in control of my thoughts. Teacher: I’m proud of Julian for changing his attitude with only a little help from me. Whatever he said to himself during that break really helped. That time, Julian changed the channel with a break and positive thinking. He gave himself time to make a smart decision on how he should act. To change the channel on big emotions: Understand the emotion you’re feeling.

We can even feel out of control sometimes. Change can occur with people, settings, or schedules. People change, like when we have a substitute teacher instead of our regular teacher. Settings change, like when we have gym outside instead of inside. And schedules change, like when we have to leave early for school. We can think about our plans like a train following its tracks. When the plan stays the same, the train stays on a single track. If there’s a change we didn’t expect, the train – that’s us! – has to switch to a new track, or a new plan. This might make us feel panicked and upset. It might feel better when your plan stay the same. Those are the times our plans are traveling on a nice straight railroad track. This feels comfortable because it’s what we’re used to. But sometimes things change, and you need to switch tracks. When your schedule changes, it can make you feel upset. It can be hard to handle the change and switch to a new track. The first step to switching tracks is to calm down on the outside. It takes hard work to stay calm on the outside. Try to relax your face, body, and voice. Take deep breaths and make sure you aren’t squeezing your muscles tightly. Once we’re calm on the outside, we want to calm down on the inside. We might need more strategies to have calm thoughts and feelings. We can count to ten, tell ourselves it will be okay, or pick something that works for us. Once we’re calm, we can think about what track we’re on, and what track we need to switch to. We think about the new plan and find one good thing about it. It might not happen right away, but after some practice, we can handle change calmly. Our brains will change tracks without worrying. Remember that our nervous and anxious feelings are just our brains worrying about switching tracks. To handle change calmly, we can: First, stay calm on the outside. We can keep a relaxed face, body, words, and voice. Next, we use a strategy to stay calm on the inside. We can use calming strategies like taking deep breaths, counting, or telling yourself it will be okay. Think about what track you’re on and what track you need to switch to.

I could call my mom. I could wait for Josh. Or I can go find Josh and talk to him. You might have come up with different solutions, and that’s okay. The next step is to pick a solution. Should Matt Call His Mom, Wait For Josh, or Find Josh and Talk To Him? Let’s watch Matt pick a solution. Matt: I think I'll just wait for Josh to tell me. I don't want to bother him. Matt decided to just wait. This might be something different than what you would have chosen. The final step is to try the solution and reassess. Let’s see what happens.

Friends put equal effort into the friendship, trust each other, and overall make each other feel good. To start a friendship, we make an effort to spend time with the other person, learn about them, and also share about ourselves. One way we learn about the other person is to ask general questions. We might ask questions about their family, their hobbies, and their likes and dislikes. It's important to remember all the facts you've learned about your friend as you talk and hang out more. Friends keep the information they've learned about each other in their heads. They use it to think of things to say in conversations or when making plans to hang out. We also want to think about how much effort each person is putting into the friendship. We want the effort to be equal, meaning each person is trying the same amount to be friends. We want to copy the effort they are making toward us. Pay attention to your friend’s efforts. Are they continuing to do small things to show they care about the friendship? After you’ve gotten to know each other for some time, you can make plans outside of school. Choose an activity you know your friend will enjoy before inviting them. This helps others get excited about the plan and say yes to it. To become a closer friend to someone: Start by asking questions Remember the facts about your friend to show you care about the things that are important to them. Make sure you’re both showing equal effort. Effort tells you a lot about how they feel about you as a friend. Before making plans outside of school, choose an activity and a day so that the plan happens. Let’s see how Niko makes a friend over time. Remember, a friendship is formed over weeks and months. Niko: Do you like to fish? Shay: Oh, yeah, I love it. My dad took me on a weekend trip this once. Niko: Me too! I fish all the time. You could come over after school today to fish. Shay: I can’t come over today. Niko: I could make you some lures, or you could probably just have all of my brother’s. Shay: No, no, I don’t want you to take your brother’s lures. Don’t do that. Niko: No, it’s fine. He’ll never know. Maybe you could even sleep over. Shay: Don’t you need to ask your mom first? I don't know if I can come tonight. Niko: You can come any day. We can make chocolate milkshakes! Shay: Remember I told you I’m allergic to milk? Niko: So, you can’t come over? Shay: No, I can’t. How did Niko make Shay feel? What do you think each of them are thinking? Niko: I think I’m being a good friend. I’m making a lot of plans. Why doesn’t Shay want to hang out? Shay: That was a lot. I like Niko, but he's made too many plans with me. And I just wish he’d remember things I’ve told him, like my allergy. Niko did not follow the rules of getting to know someone better. He made Shay feel uncomfortable because he invited him over too much. Niko also hurt Shay's feelings when he didn't remember what Shay had told him. In order to make a friend, we do a lot of thinking about them and give the friendship time. Let’s watch Niko try again. Niko: Do you like fishing? Shay: Oh, yeah, I love it. My dad took me on a weekend trip this once. Niko: Yeah, me too! My brother knows how to make lures from things around the house. Shay: Have you made any? Niko: Yeah, I made one from a bottle cap. We better start this paper. I’ll show you what it looks like later. Shay: Okay, yeah. Niko: Do you want to be my partner? Shay: Sure! Niko: Did you get the joke I sent you? Shay: Yeah, did you get mine? Niko: Yeah. It was funny because it was the worst joke ever. Shay: I know, right? Niko: Do you want to come over to my house on Thursday? We can bike to the pond and fish by my house. My mom said you can take the bus home with me. Shay: Sure! Shay: I’ll ask my mom. I don’t think I'll have anything on Thursday. Do you think we’ll catch any fish? Niko: Probably. What did Niko do differently this time? How do you think they both feel now? Niko: We’ve been talking in school for weeks, and now I’m so excited for Shay to come over! Shay: Niko and I have been talking a lot more and picking each other as partners in class. Going to his house is going to be so fun! Niko did a great job making an effort to become better friends with Shay. He asked questions to get to know Shay’s interests. They copied each other’s efforts by sending jokes back and forth and being partners. Finally, Niko organized a plan outside of school that fit both their interests. So, what did we learn?

The first step is knowing what to expect. Expect to get what you want some of the time, but not all of the time. We can’t always have things our way, or else our friends might not want to hang out or play with us. Next, know how to give something up for now. If one person gets their idea one time, then the other person can do their idea the next time. This is a fair compromise and gets the problem solved quickly. You can save your idea for later.

I don’t think I want to play with him anymore. Shay: I know Niko wants to be yellow, but I called it first. Shay was only thinking about what he wanted in this situation. This made Niko feel upset. It wasn’t very fun for Niko to play with Shay. How could Shay have compromised to solve the problem quickly and make everyone happy? Let’s watch him try again. Shay: I call being yellow!

In this game, we take a look at a situation and help the characters figure out how to act. Reading the room is a tool to help us know what to do in different situations. We can change our behavior based on where we are and what's happening. When we read the room, we pause to: Think about the situation and how you usually act in that situation. Look at everyone in the room. Think about what they are doing and what they have. Make a plan based on what you see. Sometimes, we want to do something, but when we read the room we decide that we should change our behavior based on how everyone else is acting. Reading the room helps us figure out if our behavior is right for the situation. In each scene, we'll decide how each character should act based on what's happening in the room. Anytime we see this icon in the corner, we can stop and discuss what's happening. Let's get started. Let's watch Madison read the room to figure out if it's a good time to play a game and who she can ask to play. Madison: I really want to play Heads Up. I wonder if anyone wants to play. First, I'll think about what's happening right now. We have some free time so we can pick what we want to do. It would be a good time to play a game. Next, I'll look around to see what everyone is doing. I can find someone to play with. Jack looks like he's studying his vocabulary words. Connor and Haley are quizzing each other. Who do you think is the best fit to play a game with? Madison: Now that I've looked around the room, I know what everyone is doing. Everyone is using their free time to study for tomorrow's vocabulary quiz. Jack was studying at his desk. And Connor and Haley were quizzing each other. Since everyone is studying, it doesn't seem like a good time to play a noisy game. That would distract others and make it hard for them to study. I could look over my vocabulary words too. Madison looked around the room to observe everyone's behavior. She realized that even though it was free time, it wasn't a great time to play a loud game. If Madison didn't read the room and started to play or asked others to play with her, she would have been loud and distracting. After she read the room, she was able to make the best choice based on what was happening in the room in this situation. Let's watch Justin when he wants to tell Zach a joke. Justin: I forgot to tell Zach this funny joke I heard earlier. I want to tell him now! Teacher: Okay, guys, we are running late. So I need everyone to take a seat and we can get started. Justin: What's happening right now? I thought I had a second to tell him, but now the teacher is telling us to sit down. Do I have time? I really wanted to tell Zach the joke, but everyone is getting ready. What should Justin do? Should he tell Zach the joke? Let's see what he picks. Justin: Now wouldn't be a good time to tell a joke because the teacher asked us to get ready and everyone should be listening to the lesson. Teacher: Let's open up our books to where we left off in Chapter 4. Justin was able to read the room and decide that he shouldn't tell Zach the joke right now. He really wanted to tell him, but the situation changed when the teacher told the class they were running late and had to get started. If Justin had told the joke, he would have interrupted the teacher. After he read the room, Justin knew he should save the joke for another time. Let's watch Zach read the room and decide what to talk about based on what's happening. Zach: I know Justin was going to ask Erika to the Spring dance. I wonder if he's done it yet. I want to find out. It is free time so we're allowed to talk for a little bit. Rachel and Leah are friends with Erika and they're walking over here. What should Zach do? Should he talk to Justin about the school dance? Let's see what he picks. Zach: Now definitely wouldn't be a good time to ask Justin about the school dance because Rachel and Leah might hear. That's information that Justin would want to keep private. Leah: Hey, what are you up to? Zach: We're just getting a head start on the homework. Leah: Um, we wanted to talk about the Science project if you have a second. Zach: Sure! Zach read the room and decided not to talk about the school dance with Justin when the girls walked over. He knew it wasn't the right time to talk about something that should be kept private. It's important to think about the situation and figure out the best time for different topics. That way, we won't embarrass or upset anyone. After he read the room, Zach decided not to talk about Justin's secret. Observing others is a very helpful tool. All of our characters read the room before making their choices on how to act. That way, their actions didn't make anyone feel upset, annoyed, or embarrassed. We watched Madison make sure not to play a game while others are studying, Justin wait for a better time to tell a joke, and Zach think about who's around before talking about his friend's private information. Each character made sure to: Think about the situation and how people usually act in that situation. Look at everyone in the room. Think about what they're doing and what they have. Make a plan based on what they see. Our days are made up of many constantly changing situations. If we read the room before we act, we will know how to adapt our behavior to fit each one. That way, others will have positive thoughts and feelings about us. "," - Welcome to Read the Room. In this game, we take a look at a situation and help the characters figure out how to act. Reading the room is a tool to help us know what to do in different situations. We can change our behavior based on where we are and what's happening. When we read the room, we pause to: Think about the situation and how you usually act in that situation. Look at everyone in the room. Think about what they are doing and what they have. Make a plan based on what you see. Sometimes, we want to do something, but when we read the room we decide that we should change our behavior based on how everyone else is acting. Reading the room helps us figure out if our behavior is right for the situation. In each scene, we'll decide how each character should act based on what's happening in the room. Anytime we see this icon in the corner, we can stop and discuss what's happening. Let's get started. Let's watch Madison read the room to figure out if it's a good time to play a game and who she can ask to play. Madison: I really want to play Heads Up. I wonder if anyone wants to play. First, I'll think about what's happening right now. We have some free time so we can pick what we want to do. It would be a good time to play a game. Next, I'll look around to see what everyone is doing. I can find someone to play with. Jack looks like he's studying his vocabulary words. Connor and Haley are quizzing each other. Who do you think is the best fit to play a game with? Madison: Now",0.08536613058

Think of possible solutions to the problem. Pick a solution. Try that solution and then reassess it. How did it work? If our solution works, our problem is solved! If our solution doesn’t work, we can try again. Problem solving is a process. We won’t always go straight to the solution. This video is all about problems we might have in our day to day lives. Whenever we see this icon in the corner, we can stop and talk about how everyone is feeling. Let's get started! Tyler tells Mike about a meeting after school today. Let’s see what happens next. Tyler: Hey, are you going to the homecoming meeting? Mike: Is that today? Tyler: Yeah. It's at 2:30. Mike: Oh no! I wanted to go, but I didn't plan a ride home! We need to identify what the problem is. What’s the problem? Mike: I really want to go to that meeting, but I need a ride. I know my parents can't pick me up because they're working. Mike’s problem is that he doesn’t have a ride home after school. He can’t go to the meeting if he won’t be able to get home. How big is the problem? Where would you put this on the scale? Mike: This is a small problem. I can solve it pretty quickly. Mike thinks this is a small problem. What are some solutions to Mike’s problem? Mike: I could take the late bus, but it doesn't leave until 4:30. I could see if a friend can drive me home or I could just skip the meeting. You might have come up with different solutions, and that’s okay. The next step is to pick a solution. Should Mike Take the Late Bus, Ask Someone for a Ride, or Skip the Meeting? Let’s watch Mike pick a solution. Mike: I know Tyler lives two streets down from me. I could ask him for a ride. Mike decided to ask Tyler for a ride. He would have to wait for the late bus and he doesn’t want to skip the meeting. The final step is to try the solution and reassess Let’s watch Mike try his solution. Mike: Hey, do you think your mom could drive me? My mom's working late. Tyler: Sure. That should be fine. Let’s reassess. Do you think Mike picked the best solution? Mike: That was easy to solve! I'm glad I decided not to skip the meeting. That was pretty easy for Mike to solve! Mike did a great job of thinking of his needs and asking a friend for help. Now, he can go to the meeting!

Sarcasm is a type of Disguised Thought. Understanding sarcasm can be difficult and confusing. Sometimes, a person uses sarcasm with a friend to be funny. You can tell when someone is being sarcastic by listening to their tone of voice. They might also stress one word in a sentence. This means saying one word a little louder than the others. As a listener, you could also think about the words the speaker uses and think about the situation: Does it make sense? Last, Read People’s mood by looking at their facial expression. Do their eyes or mouth show hints of a smile or laughter? Are they rolling their eyes or looking smug? These are common facial expressions people have when being sarcastic. The skills we use to figure out if someone is using sarcasm are: Listen to the person’s tone of voice. Think about the words they use and if they fit the situation. Read the person’s mood. If you’re still not sure, you can always ask the person if they are being sarcastic. Let’s watch Alessandra use these skills to figure out if Mike is using sarcasm. Alessandra: Thanks for picking up the extra work. It’s too bad Emma was sick, but it was nice of you to help with her part. Mike: Yeah, I didn’t feel like getting a full night’s sleep anyway. Alessandra: That’s an odd thing to say. Mike doesn’t like sleeping? I love sleeping. Maybe he means the opposite of what he’s saying? Mike: I just wanted some more work to do. Can’t just sit around having fun ALL the time. Alessandra: That’s another funny thing to say. His voice sounded all different than how he usually talks, and he held out the word “all” when he said “all the time”. It would make sense if he meant the opposite here. I bet he’s being sarcastic. I know. That would be too easy. Anyway, thanks. I really appreciate it. Mike: No problem. It's really not a big deal. Alessandra: Now, that time, he wasn’t joking, he was being sincere. His voice sounded normal and his face didn’t show any signs of laughing. Alessandra used the steps and figured out that Mike was being sarcastic and that he was saying the opposite of what he meant. First, she thought about the words he said and thought about the situation. Then, she listened to Mike's tone of voice. She also read his mood. She looked at his facial expression and noticed he was just barely smiling. When Alessandra put all the clues together, she figured out that Mike was being sarcastic. This helped her know what to say back and how to keep the conversation going. So, what did we learn? It can be confusing and uncomfortable if you aren’t sure when someone is being sarcastic.

Thinking about others' thoughts and feelings helps us know how to act. One of the most important things to do is to keep other people feeling good. We need to be good observers. First, we think about what’s happening. Everything people say and do, even the small things, is what’s happening. If the teacher gives a direction, that’s what’s happening. Next, we make a guess about how someone is feeling. Watch others' face and body language closely. Listen for emotions in their voices and words.

Making others happy can be even more important than doing what we want to do. Thinking about others is something we do every time we’re around people. To think about others, we can: Observe what’s happening right now. Look for clues in others' face, body, voice, and words to guess how someone feels. Think What do we know about the other person?

Did you know that? Friends can make us feel better, give us confidence, and help us in lots of ways. If we need help solving a problem or someone to talk to, they are there for us. Sometimes, we may have trouble figuring out how to play with others but there are some golden rules. These rules will help us learn to play with others. The first one is ask to play. We ask first so we know that the other person wants to play and is ready. Let’s watch Andrew ask a friend to play. Andrew: Hey, Chris! Chris: Hi! Andrew: Want to play? Chris: Sure. The second rule is to think about what you have in common. This means you and a friend like doing the same thing. Maybe you both love dance music. Knowing what we have in common helps us know what activities to do with our friends. If you’re not sure what a friend loves to do, you can always ask. Let’s watch Andrew use the second golden rule. Chris: Well, what should we do? Andrew: I know Chris and I both love to play basketball, we always play on the weekend. I’ll ask him if he wants to play. Andrew: Do you want to play basketball? Chris: Sure! Let’s play knockout! Let’s go grab some friends. Nice job thinking about what you have in common with your friends, Andrew. Andrew knew that he and Chris like to play basketball. Now it’s time for the third golden rule: Look at the group. This means using your eyes to watch others and see how they act. This helps you know how to act too. Andrew: I love playing basketball. But, how do we play knockout? Let me look at what everyone else is doing. Chris: Come on, guys. Let's start! Andrew: They're starting to get lined up. So, I'll line up too. Andrew did a great job using his eyes to look at the group. Andrew figured out how to start the game by looking at what the group was doing. If you don’t know the rules of a game, you can always ask. The next rule is to take turns. Just like during conversations, we also need to take turns when we’re playing. Imagine if you only got to play with something for a little. That wouldn't be very fun. Andrew: That was fun! I want to keep going. But I can’t take all the turns. That wouldn’t be fair. Nice job taking turns there. If one player gets all the turns, that isn’t fair. People will feel upset. When we all take turns, it makes the game more fun. Our last golden rule is to be flexible. This means being okay if things change. Someone might get sick of playing one game and want to change. That’s okay. Let's watch Andrew be flexible. Julie: That was fun! Who wants to play again? Chris: I don't know. I’m getting a little tired. Christine: Yeah, we’ve been playing for a half hour. Andrew: Wait, we can’t play without you! Julie: That's okay. We can practice free throws. Andrew: I’ve had so much fun playing with the group. I want to keep going but I don’t want to make them upset. I want to play with them again another time. Andrew: Okay, let’s go. Nice one, Andrew. He felt upset that Christine and Chris were leaving the game but he stayed calm. If he got upset, he would make the others feel uncomfortable. He showed he can be flexible. Andrew showed us all the golden rules and taught us that playing with others is good for us. Let’s remember our golden rules: Ask to play. Find what you have in common. Look at the group. Take turns. Be flexible. Using these rules will help us have fun with others and keep friendships which is good for us. "," - Playing with others can keep our brains and bodies healthy. Did you know that?

To know how we’re feeling and stay in control we use our Self-Controller Scanner. The Self-Controller Scanner is how you check your body, feelings and thoughts. It helps you know when you need to calm down and get control of your thoughts and feelings. Scan your brain and body to see: Am I so distracted by an emotion that I don’t know or care what else is going on? This means our emotions are controlling our thoughts. How are my brain and body feeling? Are all my thoughts and feelings negative? If they are, your emotions are controlling your thoughts. When you notice these things, it's time to take control by: Choosing a calming strategy. Take a break. Take deep breaths. Think of one positive thought. The skills we use to activate our Self-Controller Scanner are: Scan your brain and body to figure out when you are losing control. Pick a strategy you can use to get back in control. Take the steps you need to get back in control. You might need to talk to an adult or ask for help. Let’s see how Kai uses his Self-Controller Scanner. Teacher: I’m sorry guys, we have a change in our schedule today. We won’t be able to go outside for extra recess, so... we’ll have to do it tomorrow. Instead, we’re going to read about the life cycle of a butterfly. Kai: What?! I brought in my sneakers because I thought we were going outside. I might be losing control. I should scan my brain and body with my Self-Controller Scanner! Am I paying attention? Do I know what everyone is talking about? No, I don’t know what my teacher is talking about now. I keep thinking about how I brought in my sneakers for nothing. How am I feeling? Do I feel calm and neutral or am I feeling a bigger emotion? I feel very hot and I have a lump in my throat. I’m having a big emotion. I feel angry and upset. I’m losing control. What strategy can I use to help me get back in control? I could ask for a break or take deep breaths. I need to take a break. That’s the best strategy for me right now because I don’t want to lose control in class. When we feel like we might lose control of our feelings, we need to use our Self-Controller Scanner. Scan your brain to see if you’re paying attention. Scan your body to see how you’re feeling. Then, pick a strategy that will get you back in control.

Our strengths are the things we are good at, our weaknesses are the things we could improve. Having a growth mindset means we believe that our abilities can improve over time. It’s believing that we can turn our weaknesses into strengths. The opposite of a Growth Mindset is a Fixed Mindset. A fixed mindset is the belief that your strengths and weaknesses are fixed and can’t be changed. People with a fixed mindset quit and move on to something else once they discover they aren’t good at something because they think they need to find their talents, not develop them. Research shows that simply believing we can accomplish something makes us more likely to succeed. People who have a growth mindset keep working at things until they are good at them and end up having a lot of talents. Let’s talk about three ways to help us keep a growth mindset. Use the Power of ‘Yet’ With a growth mindset, you tell yourself that you are not good at writing 'yet.' Try thinking of a skill that you want to get better at. Now, add the word ‘yet’ to the end of that statement. Teachers, pause here to practice this exercise with your students. Accept failure Having a growth mindset means believing that even if you fail, you can still succeed in a different way. For example, if we try using a planner, but keep forgetting to bring it to school, then we can come up with another way to succeed. Maybe next time, we try sticky notes instead. Be open-minded Having a growth mindset means we’re open to others’ ideas. We might ask for help coming up with a new way to improve. We’re open to hearing others tell us what we did wrong because we’re excited to improve. When we use a growth-mindset, there is not much we can’t accomplish. DISCUSSION: Why is recognizing our strengths important? Why do people with a ‘growth mindset’ accomplish more goals? How can one of your strengths help you accomplish a goal?

Mike: She didn’t know what base and body meant. She must not know I’m building a model rocket with my dad. Once we know the conversation is off track and why, we can figure out how to get it back on track. How do you think Mike could repair the conversation? Mike: I need to tell her what we're working on! That way, she’ll understand what I’m talking about. Mike should give Alessandra more background information so she can understand his story. Let’s watch him get the conversation back on track. Mike: Oh, I'm sorry. I should have told you. I'm building a model rocket with my dad. Alessandra: Oh, that's cool! How long do you think it wil take to finish? Mike: We're hoping we'll have it done in a month or two. Now Alessandra knows that Mike was talking about building a model rocket. He gave her all of the details so she wasn’t confused anymore. This conversation is now running smoothly. Alessandra is talking about a quiz she just took. Let’s see how Serena responds. Serena: How is the vocab quiz? Alessandra: It was so hard. No, I finished it in 5 minutes. Serena: That's not that long. How hard could it be? Alessandra: Um... Alessandra looks confused! The first step is to realize the conversation is off track. How did Serena know that Alessandra was confused? Let’s see what Serena is thinking. Serena: Hmm... That didn't go right. When I said, ""How hard could it be?"" Alessandra looked confused. The next step is to figure out where the conversation went off track. Why was Alessandra confused? Let’s take a look at what Serena thinks. Serena: Now that I think about it, her tone of voice sounded sarcastic. She held out the word “so”. I think she meant the opposite of what she said. Once we know the conversation is off track and why, we can figure out how to get it back on track. How do you think Serena will repair the conversation? Serena: She meant that it was easy, so I can make a comment about that. Serena can let Alessandra know that she understands what she meant. She can make a comment to show Alessandra she understands. Serena: Oh... you were kidding! I'm glad it's easy. I have English next. Alessandra: You'll be fine. Once Serena was able to understand what Alessandra was saying, they continued their conversation. Serena did a great job of going back through the conversation and figuring out what Alessandra meant! Liz is talking with someone but doesn’t remember their name. Let’s see what happens. Matt: Hey, Liz! Liz: Hi... Um... This conversation is stopped! Liz knows that it’s off track. Liz: Oh no, I don’t know what to say. And where it went off track Liz: I can’t remember his name. He’s new in class! He looks uncomfortable. Why would not knowing someone’s name make the conversation go off track? Once we know the conversation is off track and why, we can figure out how to get it back on track. How do you think Liz will repair the conversation? Liz: I don’t want to hurt his feelings. I should just ask him his name so I’ll know for the future. Liz is going to ask Matt his name, so she’ll know it for next time. Liz: I'm sorry, what's your name again? Matt: Oh, I'm Matt. I was just wondering where the art room is. Liz: Oh, walk down the hall and it's to the right. You'll see it. Matt: Alright. Thanks! If we don’t know someone’s name, it’s okay to ask. The longer we wait, the more uncomfortable it can be. Knowing someone’s name is a key to getting conversations running smoothly! Mike is talking to Tyler about the track team. Let’s see how this conversation goes. Mike: I think I want to join the track team. Tyler: Oh? Mike: Yeah. I liked when we ran the mile in gym class. I think I'd like being on the team. Tyler: Yeah. Uh-oh, Mike stopped talking! The first step is to realize the conversation is off track. How did Tyler know that the conversation was off track? Let’s see what Tyler is thinking. Tyler: Mike isn’t making eye contact with me anymore and stopped talking. Did I do something to make him feel bad? The next step is to figure out where the conversation went off track. Why did Mike stop talking? Let’s take a look at what Tyler thinks. Tyler: He was telling me about the track team and I didn’t say much. Maybe that’s why he stopped the conversation. Tyler was giving Mike very short answers. Once we know the conversation is off track and why, we can figure out how to get it back on track. How do you think Tyler will repair the conversation? Tyler: I could ask him questions about the team. and use my body language to show him I’m listening. Tyler can show Mike he’s listening with his body and by making comments and asking questions. Tyler: So how often does the team meet? Mike: Every Friday. Tyler: Really? What event do you plan on doing? Mike: The 100 meters, I think. I like sprinting better. Tyler: Cool! Once Tyler showed he was interested in what Mike had to say, he was able to get the conversation back on track! People probably won’t want to continue talking if we’re showing them signs that we’re not interested. Being interested and engaged in the conversation will help keep our conversations going! Great job working on our problem solving today! Solving problems in conversations can be tricky! If a conversation isn’t going the way you expected, think about what’s happening and observe the other person. How are they acting? Are they asking you questions? You can go back and try to figure out where it went off track That might give you some clues to get it back on track. See you next time! "," - Welcome to Repair the Conversation a game where we look at conversations, figure out where they went off track, and how we can get the conversation back on track.

In this video, we're going to decide if people are thinking about the people around them or not thinking about the people around them. When we think about others, we try to put ourselves in their shoes and see how they will feel. Our actions can make other people have either positive or not so positive thoughts about us. We should try to think about how our actions will make others feel. If our actions are going to make others upset or uncomfortable, we can change our behavior. We're going to watch video clips and your job is to decide if the main character was thinking about other people's feelings or not. Every time we see this icon in the corner, we should stop and discuss what happened. Think about how everyone feels and why. Let's get started. Zach and Leah are drawing when Leah starts to get frustrated. Let's see what happens. Leah: Ugh! Zach: What's wrong? Leah: Nothing. I just can't get the shading right. Zach: I think it looks awesome. Leah: Really? Zach: Yeah. It's great. Don't worry about it. Leah: Thanks! Did Zach think about Leah and her feelings? Yes, he did. Zach noticed that Leah was becoming frustrated and tried to make her feel better. He thought about how she felt and took some steps to help her. Giving compliments is a great way to make others feel better. Let's watch Rachel as she's talking to Justin. Rachel: How did your karate tournament go? Justin: Not too good. Rachel: Oh, what happened? Justin: I'll tell you later. Rachel: Did you get your black belt? Justin: No, I didn't. Do you think Rachel thought about Justin and his feelings? Rachel wasn't thinking about Justin's feelings. His tone of voice and body language gave clues that he wasn't feeling good about his karate tournament and didn't want to talk about it. Rachel shouldn't have kept asking about it because that made him feel worse. What do you think Rachel could have said to Justin instead of continuing to talk about the karate tournament? Let's watch Leah as Rachel tries to find a space to work. Rachel: Is anybody sitting there? Leah: Nope. Rachel: Alright then. Was Leah thinking about Rachel? Leah wasn't thinking about Rachel. Leah should have looked at Rachel and where Rachel was looking to figure out what Rachel wanted. Rachel wanted to sit on the chair next to Leah, but Leah's bags were on it. Leah should have noticed the clues Rachel was giving her and moved her bags. Try to notice what others might be trying to tell you with their words and actions. Let's see if Alessandra thinks about Tyler during their conversation. Alessandra: Hey, Tyler! Tyler: Hey, Alessandra! How's your weekend? Alessandra: It was so fun! We went to a food truck festival. Tyler: What's that? I've never heard of it. Alessandra: They have all these restaurants inside these big trucks. They're all parked downtown. Tyler: What kind of foods were there? Alessandra: There are sandwiches, some had pizza. Tyler: What was your favorite food? Alessandra: I definitely like the taco truck best. It was so good. Tyler: That sounds awesome. Did Alessandra think about Tyler during their conversation? She did. Tyler didn't know what a food truck festival was so she explained it to him. If Alessandra kept talking without explaining, Tyler would have been very confused. It's important to think about your listener and make sure you explain the important details to them when you tell a story. Zach and Leah are chatting about their weekend. Notice if Zach thinks about Leah. Zach: Hey, Leah! Leah: Hey! How was your weekend? Zach: It was awesome! Sadie and I went down to Crescent Corner. We played in the water there. Leah: Um... who's Sadie and what's Crescent Corner? Zach: Um... Sadie and I always go to Crescent Corner and play in the water. Did Zach think about Leah during their conversation? No, Zach wasn't thinking about Leah. Leah seemed confused and didn't know what Zach was talking about. Zach needed to think about the person he's talking to and make sure he tells her all of the information she needs to understand his story. What could Zach have said instead? Anytime we're around other people, we should think about how we're acting and how they will feel. Some examples of thinking about others were: Giving someone a compliment when someone is feeling frustrated. Zach: I think it looks awesome. Leah: Really? Zach: Yeah. It's great. Don't worry about it. Leah: Thanks! And explaining details to someone when they need more information. Tyler: What's that? I've never heard of it. Alessandra: They have all these restaurants inside these big trucks. They're all parked downtown. Some examples of not thinking about others are: Not knowing when to drop something when someone gives you clues they don't want to talk about a certain topic. Rachel: How did your karate tournament go? Justin: Not too good. Rachel: Oh, what happened? Justin: I'll tell you later. Rachel: Did you get your black belt? And taking up all the space when someone else needs it. Rachel: Is anybody sitting there? Leah: Nope. Rachel: Alright then. If we want to put ourselves in someone else's shoes, we should try to stop and think. How would I feel if this happened to me? What am I doing and how will this make someone else feel? It's also important to read the clues from others. By looking at people's body language and actions, we can tell how they are feeling. This helps us make decisions about what to do next.

During this activity, you’ll try to figure out how people are going to react in different situations. After each video, you’ll get three choices. Then, you have to guess which one of those choices is going to happen next. This video is all about using the Relationship Ruler. The Relationship Ruler helps us figure out how to act around different people. Depending on how long we’ve known a person or how close we are to them, there are actions we do or don’t do. We’re often closest with our family. We’re around them all the time. We share more about our lives and can physically touch or hug them. The next level is our closest friends. These are the friends we’ve known the longest. We hang out and talk with them outside of school many times a week. Next, we have our friends. These are people we’ve known for a while because it takes time to build friendships. We talk and hangout with these people outside of school. Then, we have acquaintances. These are people we know a little. We might be in the same class and have had a couple conversations with them, but we don’t talk a lot. Lastly, there are strangers. These are people we don’t know at all. It’s important to be safe around strangers. We only talk to them if someone you know introduces you. After each clip, you’ll have to decide if the characters did or did not use the Relationship Ruler. While watching, ask yourself: What kind of relationship do they have? Did the conversation or actions of the person match the relationship level? If not, what could they have done differently? Whenever you see this icon in the corner, stop to talk and answer the questions about the situation you just watched. Let’s get started! In this video, we’ll focus on Natalie. Let’s see how this conversation goes. Madison: Hey, Natalie! Natalie: Oh, hi, Madison. Madison: How did you do on those Spanish tests? Natalie: I don't know. It's pretty hard. Madison: Yeah, I had a hard time too. What do you think will happen next? Natalie will... Tell Madison she feels uncomfortable. Continue the conversation with Madison. Make an excuse to leave the conversation. Natalie: You know what? I need to get to class. Madison: Okay, see you later then. Natalie: See ya! Natalie made an excuse to leave the conversation. Why do you think she did this? Where do you think Madison and Natalie’s relationship falls on the Relationship Ruler? They are friends. Did Madison use the Relationship Ruler? Did her actions towards Natalie match that of a friend? Madison did not use the Relationship Ruler. Even though Madison’s topic of conversation was appropriate for a friend, she was too touchy and did not give Natalie enough personal space. This made Natalie feel uncomfortable and want to end the conversation. Did you notice Natalie’s reaction when Madison hugged her? Or when she moved away from Madison? If the person is a stranger, acquaintance, or a friend, it’s important to respect their personal space and not get too close when talking. Can you think of a time when someone invaded your personal space? How did it make you feel? Where was this person on your Relationship Ruler? In this video, we’ll focus on Niko. Let’s see how this conversation goes. Niko: Hey, Andy. You left your sleeping bag at my house like you do every time. Andy: That's okay. I’ll just get it when I'm at your house tomorrow. Can I talk to you? Niko: Yeah, what’s up? Andy: My parents told me that... we're moving this summer. What do you think will happen next? Niko will... Roll his eyes Listen and help his friend Feel awkward listening to this news Niko: Wow, I’m so sorry, Andy. Do you know where you’re moving to? Andy: Just the next town over, but I’ll have to switch schools. Niko: That’s a big change, but at least we'll be able to hang out. It's not like you're moving states or anything. Andy: Yeah, I guess you’re right. We’ll still be able to hang out. Niko: Totally! We’ll always have sleepovers. Niko listened and wanted to be a helpful friend to Andy. Where do you think Andy and Niko’s relationship falls on the Relationship Ruler? They’re close friends. Did Andy use the Relationship Ruler? Were his actions and what he shared with Niko appropriate for a close friend? Yes! His actions and topic of conversation were appropriate for a close friend. Niko felt comfortable when Andy shared personal information because they’re very close friends. It’s okay to tell a close friend something personal or a secret. These are the relationships that we have formed over months or years. It’s also okay to touch a close friend, by giving a friendly high five or a fist bump. Who are some people in your life that you trust and feel comfortable sharing personal information with? In this round, we’ll focus on Madison. Madison: I can’t believe it’s the first day of school already. Shay: I know. This summer flew by! I’m Shay by the way. Madison: I’m Madison. Shay: Did you have a good summer? What do you think will happen next? Madison will... Answer Shay’s question and share that her grandma was sick all summer. Answer Shay’s question and ask him about his summer. Ask Shay where he goes to the beach in the summer. Madison: Yeah, I did. I went to camp most of it. What about you? Shay: No way. Me too. Which camp? Madison: I went to an all-girls sleep-away camp. Shay: I’ve never been to a sleep-away camp. Madison: It’s really fun! Shay: I went to a basketball camp. Madison: Cool! Madison answered Shay with a general comment about her summer and then asked him about his summer. Where do you think Madison and Shay’s relationship falls on the Relationship Ruler? We know Madison and Shay are acquaintances because they just met and got to know each other a little. Did Madison use the Relationship Ruler? Did she share information that is okay to share with an acquaintance? Yes, Madison used her Relationship Ruler! She shared general information about her summer with Shay. When we have a conversation with someone we just met, we want to make sure we talk about general things that stay positive. We don’t want to overshare too many personal details or complain because the other person will feel uncomfortable. Sometimes, when we talk to acquaintances, we might not care about what someone is saying or find it interesting. What should we do then? In this video, we’ll focus on Natalie. Natalie: Hi, Mrs. B. Do you have a second? I'm stuck on this Math homework. Teacher: Sure. Just let me finish this up quickly. Natalie: Did you hear about Jackie? She has a huge crush on Ryan. Teacher: No, I didn’t know that. Natalie: Yeah, she just told me. I can’t believe it! What do you think will happen next? The teacher will... Want to talk more about Jackie. Tell Natalie she’s in trouble for talking about that. Tell Natalie that this topic of conversation isn’t for teachers. Teacher: I don’t think Jackie would want you telling me that. That sounds like private information for friends. Natalie: Oh, okay. Sorry, Mrs. B. Teacher: That’s okay. Let’s look at your Math homework. Mrs. Brunell did not want to discuss this topic because it’s inappropriate for a teacher and student. Where do you think Natalie and Mrs. B’s relationship falls on the Relationship Ruler? A teacher isn’t the same as your friend. They’re more of an acquaintance that you know and trust. Did Natalie use the Relationship Ruler? Were her actions and questions appropriate for an acquaintance? No, Natalie did not use the Relationship Ruler. Her topic of conversation was more appropriate for Friends than for an adult or acquaintance. We have to be careful when we talk about other's personal information. Natalie’s friend Jackie probably did not want her teacher to know who she has a crush on. That should stay between friends. The way we talk to adults should be different than how we talk to our friends. What would have been a better topic to talk about with her teacher? Today, we saw how we can use the Relationship Ruler across many situations. We watched how we: Give friends personal space. Trust close friends with personal information. Share general information with acquaintances. And use different topics with adults than people our own age. The Relationship Ruler helps us think about what to share and how to act with others based on how close we are to them. We talk about private details and problems with the people who are closest to us on this side of the ruler. With friends and acquaintances on this side of the ruler, we should talk about more general things like school or what’s happening that day. Remember to use the Relationship Ruler in your life to help you think about how you act around all the different people you see. "," - Welcome to Guess What Happens Next.

We want to be aware of how often we are disagreeing. If we agree most of the time, others will have positive feelings about us. It’s okay to disagree once in a while, but too often can make it seem like we’re arguing, or insisting on having our way all the time. Other people might stop inviting us to do things with them if we’re always disagreeing. To help you, think about when it’s likely you’ll get your way and when it’s not likely. You’re not likely to get your way when no one agrees with you. That’s a time when you should give up your idea and agree with someone else’s. We remain calm and friendly when we’re agreeing to someone else's way. It’s okay to say what you wanted as you agree to someone else’s idea. We never agree to an idea that’s unkind, hurtful, or against the rules. In those situations, we stick to our opinion even if we’re the only one who’s doing the right thing. One of the ways we stay enjoyable to be around is agreeing more often than we disagree with others. To do this, we: Agree many times before you disagree one time. If no one in a group is agreeing with you, it’s probably a good time to back down on your idea and agree with someone else’s idea. Agree to other's ideas with neutral emotions, or friendly words and tones. Let’s see how Shay agrees more than he disagrees. Shay: Alright. We should figure out our Halloween costumes. Niko: Definitely! We should go as something with three characters so that we all can go together. Andy: Yeah, let's go with something scary. We can get paint our faces or put on masks. Niko: Yeah, let’s do it. I have a werewolf mask! Shay: Guys, I got it. Let’s be a band. We could have guitars and spiky hair. Niko: I don’t really know if I have the clothing for a band. Andy: Yeah, and I don’t really want to carry around an instrument. Shay: You guys aren’t listening to me! Niko: No, we are. We just don’t really want to be a band. It’s no big deal. Shay: I’m doing my own Halloween costume! I don’t want to be in your group or trick or treat with you! What happened there? Shay had a suggestion, but others didn’t agree with him. Would he have been better off agreeing? Let’s see what others are thinking. Andy: It's hard to hang out with Shay. He always disagrees with us. Niko: If Shay doesn’t get his way, he just leaves. He misses out on a lot of fun stuff. Shay: I had a better idea for costumes! We should do my idea! Shay wouldn’t consider a new idea or listen to what the group wanted. This made his friends feel annoyed. Now, Shay’s going to miss out on trick or treating with them. What could he have done instead? Let’s watch Shay try again. Shay: Alright. We should figure out our Halloween costumes. Niko: Definitely! We should go as something with three characters so that we all can go together. Andy: Yeah, let's go with something scary. We can paint our faces or put on masks. Niko: Yeah, let’s do it. I have a werewolf mask. Shay: Guys, I got it. Let’s be a band. We could have guitars and spiky hair... Niko: I don’t really know if I have the clothing for a band. Andy: Yeah, and I don’t really want to carry around an instrument. Shay: No one agrees with my idea. I really wanted a band costume. I have been disagreeing with them lately. If I agree with them, I’ll have a group to go trick or treating with. Shay: Okay, we can be scary costumes. Andy: Awesome! Niko: Awesome! This is going to be so fun. Who do you guys want to go as? Shay: I’ll be Dracula. Andy: I’ll be a skeleton. Niko: I’ll be a werewolf! Let’s see what others think about Shay now. Niko: I can’t wait to go trick or treating with Shay and Andy. Andy: That was easy to decide! I’m glad we all agreed. Shay: I’m glad I agreed with the group. Now we’ll have a lot of fun on Halloween. That time, Shay agreed to the group’s plan. This kept him in the group so everyone can have fun trick or treating. Andy and Niko had positive thoughts about Shay when he agreed more than he disagreed. Even if we don’t get our way, it’s important to think about what’s fun for more people in the group, not just us. What did we learn? If we agree more than we disagree, our friends and others will enjoy being around us. Agree many times before you disagree one time. If no one in a group is agreeing with you, it’s probably a good time to back down on your idea and agree with someone else’s idea. Agree to other's ideas with neutral emotions, or friendly words and tones. "," - Everyone has their own opinions and feelings about things. We want to be aware of how often we are disagreeing. If we agree most of the time, others will have positive feelings about us. It’s okay to disagree once in a while, but too often can make it seem like we’re arguing, or insisting on having our way all the time. Other people might stop inviting us to do things with them if we’re always disagreeing. To help you, think about when it’s likely you’ll get your way and when it’s not likely. You’re not likely to get your way when no one agrees with you. That’s a time when you should give up your idea and agree with someone else’s. We remain calm and friendly when we’re agreeing to someone else's way. It’s okay to say what you wanted as you agree to someone else’s idea. We never agree to an idea that’s unkind, hurtful, or against the rules. In those situations, we stick to our opinion even if we’re the only one who’s doing the right thing. One of the ways we stay enjoyable to be around is agreeing more often than we disagree with others. To do this, we: Agree many times before you disagree one time. If no one in a group is agreeing with you, it’s probably a good time to back down on your idea and agree with someone else’s idea.

This is called putting yourself in someone else’s shoes. Empathy helps us form friendships because it helps us connect with others. When others see that you care about how they feel, they will feel closer to you in return. We can use the Empathy Essentials to learn this skill. First, we figure out how the person is feeling. Once you know how they’re feeling, you need to do an action to show you care. It’s not enough to just think about their feelings, we need to show them. Saying something like, “I know how you feel,” might seem small, but is important to show others that you care about them. To use our Empathy Essentials and feel closer to our friends, we can: First, figure out how the person is feeling. Then, show the person we understand their feelings by doing an action or saying something nice. Let’s watch Simon show empathy to his friend, Liz. Simon: What’s up, Liz? Liz: Oh, hey. Simon: You look sad. What’s up? Liz: I missed the field trip yesterday because I was sick. Simon: Oh no! Liz looks pretty sad. I would be sad too if I missed a field trip. Maybe I should let Liz know I understand how she’s feeling. Simon: I’m sorry you were sick yesterday. I hate missing out on cool field trips too. Liz: Yeah. Thanks, Simon. Simon: I heard we're going to have a half day next week. That will be fun. Liz: Yeah, it will! Let's see how Simon made Liz feel. Liz: I was feeling really sad, but Simon made me feel better. He gets how I feel and tried to cheer me up. What a good friend. Simon: When I talk to friends, I notice how they feel. I read Liz's facial expression and body language to figure out how she felt. When she mentioned she missed the field trip, I knew I could use the Empathy Essentials to try to make her feel better. I thought about how I would feel if I missed it and then I try to think of something to say to cheer her up. She seemed happier when we talked about the half day coming up. Simon used the Empathy Essentials to connect and feel closer with his friend, Liz. First, Simon read Liz’s mood by looking at her body language and listening to her tone of voice. Then, Simon thought about how the situation would make him feel. Simon wouldn’t feel very good if he missed the class field trip either. He realized Liz probably felt sad. Finally, Simon thought about what he could say to try to make Liz feel better. By letting Liz know he understood her feelings, he was able to cheer her up. So, what did we learn? We can use empathy to show friends that we care about them and to build stronger friendships. To use our Empathy Essentials and feel closer to our friends, we should: Figure out how the person is feeling. Show the person we understand their feelings and care about them by doing or saying something. "," - Having empathy means you can understand how someone else feels in a particular situation.

We use clues like reading body language and facial expressions to help us figure out how a person feels. Reading facial expressions can tell us how someone feels. Look at the big three: eyes, eyebrows, and mouth when we read someone’s facial expression. These parts of the face show emotions the most. Lifted eyes, eyebrows, and mouths are all signs of positive feelings like happiness, pride, or interest. When eyes widen or eyebrows lift, it’s a sign of a positive feeling. The same is true for the mouth. The corners of the mouth lift up when we smile. Lowered eyes, eyebrows, and mouths are all signs of negative feelings like sadness, frustration, or boredom. This could be eyes that are looking down, furrowed, scrunched eyebrows, or a mouth that is frowning. Another important clue is to notice a person’s body language. We try to notice a person’s body position. Are they facing towards or away from you? Did they lean in and get closer to you or move away? Their arms and hands. Are they crossed or relaxed by their side? If someone is turned away from us, has their arms crossed, and is looking around the room, how do you think they feel? They probably feel anxious or upset. Try to let others know that you understand how they feel. If someone is facing you, making eye contact, and smiling, how do you think they feel? They probably feel happy or relaxed. Lastly, don’t forget to think about how you would feel in the same situation. Has something similar ever happened to you? How did it make you feel? Putting ourselves in someone else’s shoes and showing them we understand how they feel helps us be a better friend. Once we know how someone feels, we will know the best thing to say or do in that moment. To help us know how others are feeling, we: Read facial expressions. Remember, the big three, eyes, eyebrows, and mouth, are the best clues to tell you how someone feels. Look at other's body language. Notice the way their body is positioned, where their arms are and where they’re looking. Putting ourselves in someone else’s shoes helps us be a better friend. Let’s watch Leah try to read facial expressions. Rachel: Wow, I wasn't expecting that. Leah: It seems like it went well? Rachel: Yeah, I did better than I thought. Leah: Mm-hmm. Leah: When I want to see how someone is feeling, I look at their eyes, mouth, and body language. These give me clues to how they might feel. I also think about the situation or what I know has happened. When I put all these together, I can guess how they feel. I could tell that Rachel felt surprised and happy because of her quiz grade. When we want to tell how someone is feeling, we: Look at the big three. How do their eyes, eyebrows, and mouth look? Notice other's body language. And think about what is happening right now. How would you feel in the same situation? When we put all the clues together, we can guess how others feel. So, what did we learn? To help us know how others are feeling, we: Read facial expressions. Remember, the big three -- eyes, eyebrows, and mouth -- which show the most feelings, are the best clues to tell you how someone feels. Look at other's body language.

Sometimes we have long conversations, and sometimes we have short ones. There are times when we are supposed to give a short answer to a question. And then there are other times we can give longer answers. The trouble is if we switch up these times, we can make people feel confused or uncomfortable. To help us know how much we should be talking, we can use our Conversation Measuring Cup. When we don't have a lot of time to talk or someone else needs to tell you something, it's time to give a shorter answer. This would only fill the Conversation Measuring Cup a little bit. If we have a lot of time to talk or you're getting signs that someone really wants to talk, we can give a longer answer. This would fill the Conversation Measuring Cup almost to the top. We always want to make sure others have a turn to talk too. We can tell our story or a long answer and then wait to give them a chance to talk. Our Conversation Measuring Cup tells us to: Talk a little when a friend says ""Hey"" or ""What's up?"" Talk a lot when people ask us lots of questions and show interest. Remember to give others a chance to speak no matter what. Let's watch what it looks like if we don't use the Conversation Measuring Cup. Madison: Hey, Connor. What's up? Connor: I am having the luckiest day ever! First, I found $20 in my pocket. I'm super excited because I'm saving up for a new game. Then, I was supposed to have a quiz in Science, but the fire alarm rang so we won't have it until tomorrow. This gives me way more time to study. Madison: Wow! That's... really lucky. Connor: I know! I didn't have much time to study for Science last night, but I'm totally free tonight. I wonder what else will happen today. Maybe I should play the lottery and I'll win big! Madison: Oh... uh... alright. Did Connor use the Conversation Measuring Cup? Was it a good time to give a long answer like that? Let's see what Madison is thinking. Madison: I wasn't expecting Connor to go on like that. Usually when someone says ""What's up?,"" I say one small thing. I didn't expect him to talk that much. Madison was feeling a little confused when Connor gave a really long answer about his day. Connor didn't use his Conversation Measuring Cup. If he did, he would have realized that it was time to give a short answer. When people asks us ""What's up?,"" they usually think they'll get a quick sentence back. Connor could have said ""I'm having an awesome day! I found $20 and my Science quiz was postponed because of the fire alarm."" Now let's see a time for a long response. Madison: Hey, Connor! How was Science class? I know you had a big quiz. Connor: Good. Madison: Well, you look happy. How did you do? Connor: Good. Madison: Oh... okay. That time, Madison was disappointed because she had more time to talk and wanted longer answers. Connor should have thought about the Conversation Measuring Cup to figure out that this was a time to give a longer answer. When people ask us a lot of questions, that's a clue that they're in the mood to talk and want to hear from us. When Connor gave such short answers, it didn't make for a very good conversation. How were these two scenarios different? In the first scenario, Madison said, ""What's up?,"" which is a polite greeting, but not a specific question. Madison was looking for a short answer in return. The second time, Madison asked Connor specific questions, which means she wanted to have a longer conversation. Connor only gave one word answers back and his voice and body language wasn't very excited or enthusiastic, which made Madison feel like he didn't want to talk. If someone asks us a general question like, ""How's your day?"" or ""What's up?,"" they usually want a short answer. But if someone asks you about something more specific, they're letting you know it's okay for you to talk for a longer amount of time. Use the Conversation Measuring Cup and think about the questions they're asking you and how long they are talking to help you know how long you should talk for. What did we learn? Our Conversation Measuring Cup tells us to: Talk a little when a friend says ""Hey"" or ""What's up?"" Talk a lot when people ask us lots of questions and show interest. Remember to give others a chance to speak no matter what. "," - Our conversations with others are always different. Sometimes we have long conversations, and sometimes we have short ones.

Not everything is bullying, though. There's a difference between friendly teasing, hurtful teasing, and bullying.",Handling Teasing and Bullying,,,,,,https://res.cloudinary.com/everyday-speech/raw/upload/v1619172305/SubtitlesVTT/DZAFYwZT6y_M137_What_is_Bullying.vtt," - Bullying is when someone repeatedly tries to hurt someone’s feelings, or control them in some way. People bully to feel more powerful than others. There’s a difference between bullying, friendly teasing, and hurtful teasing. Friendly teasing between good friends is fun. No one gets upset because they know each other well and are allowed to tease each other about inside jokes. Hurtful teasing is when someone is mean once, but not over and over. Bullying is when a person is mean multiple times to someone, not just once, but many times. They are purposely trying to control others and make them feel bad. It can be mean comments, forcing others to do something, hurting people, or any unwanted touching. Bullying hurts people's feelings, making them feel small or afraid.

There are a few steps you can take when you need to solve a problem. The first step is to identify the problem. Julie: I want to go to the after school club today, but I didn't tell my mom.

Next, she needs to decide if this is a big or small problem. Big problems may need the help of an adult. A small problem is one you can solve yourself pretty quickly. Julie: Is this a big problem or a small problem? If my mom didn't know where I was, it would be a big problem. She would be very worried. I'm not sure what to do, so I'm going to ask for help. Ms. Lehane, I need help. I want to stay after school today, but I don't have a phone to call my mom and ask. Nice job asking for help. Now Julie and her teacher will think of some different solutions to the problem. Julie: Hmm... what should I do? Maybe I could use someone's phone after school.

We all do this to be polite. For example, if someone asks, “Do you like my outfit?” it is polite to say yes, even if you don’t like it. This is a time it’s better to not hurt someone than to be honest. Let’s see how white lies can help us so we don’t hurt other people’s feelings. Jeff: Hey, guess what. I just signed up for a summer camp where we sleep in tents in the mountains for 2 weeks! Doesn’t that sound like fun? Mike: I’m not really that into camping. Sleeping outside doesn’t sound that fun to me. Jeff: Oh, I thought it sounded fun. Jeff looks sad. Let’s see what everyone is thinking. Jeff: I was really excited about my trip, but Mike didn’t think it was a good idea. I guess it really wasn't as cool as I thought. Mike: Why is Jeff so upset? I didn’t say anything mean, I just don’t like camping, which is the truth! Jeff is upset and Mike is confused. Mike didn’t want to make Jeff feel bad, but in this case telling the truth hurt Jeff’s feelings. Mike should pay attention to how Jeff is acting. If Jeff is very excited, Mike can make him feel good by encouraging him. Let’s watch Mike try again. Jeff: Guess what. I just signed up for a summer camp where we sleep in tents in the mountains for 2 weeks! Doesn’t that sound exciting? Mike: I wouldn’t want to go to that camp. But Jeff is really excited. I don’t want to hurt his feelings. It isn’t exactly the truth but I’ll tell him it sounds fun. Yeah, man, that sounds awesome! Jeff: It’s by a lake so we can swim and fish there too! I can’t wait. Mike: Cool! That time, Mike thought about Jeff’s feelings. Even though he doesn’t like camping, he pretended like he thought it was cool. By telling a white lie, he was able to keep talking to Jeff without hurting Jeff’s feelings. Remember, sometimes it’s okay to tell a white lie. You’re not being 100% honest but it’s better than making someone feel bad. Can you think of a good time to use a white lie?
